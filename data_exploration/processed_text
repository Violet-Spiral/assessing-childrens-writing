2,Did you know horses can point their ears more than we can? Did you know that horses can groom one another? Horses can also see more than we can. They can see what is behind and what is in front of them. Some horses live in North America  South America  Europe  and Australia. Fifty-five million years ago horses were dog sized. Horses are black  brown  white  and spotted. Horses like to eat grass. Horses live on a farm and outside. Horses played a big role in the development of our country. They carried people west. They pulled covered wagons  firewagons  farmers plows  and stagecoaches. They carried the mail. In the 1900s the horse was replaced by the car and the train. The largest horse is the Percheron. It is 21 hands high. The smallest horse is the Falabella. It is only 7 hands high. Horses usually have one baby a year. They live 25 to 35 years. I wish I could be like a horse because they know when they are in danger.

Ladybugs are harmless  but if you pick one up it will tickle you! Ladybugs are very helpful to farmers because they eat aphids. Aphids are tiny bugs that eat plants.

3,You should never race a cheetah. Do you know why? Because youll always lose. Thats because cheetahs are very fast runners. They can run up to 75 miles per hour. The cheetah gets its food by running. But sometimes the lion takes over and grabs the food. Thats mean! Cheetahs are carnivores. That means they eat meat. Their prey are gazelles and rodents. The cheetah lives and finds food in Africa. The cheetah and the lion eat each other. If the cheetah is weaker  the lion eats the cheetah  and its the same with the other. The cheetah has up to three to five babies. The cheetah has larger litters than other cats  but on average only two cubs live into adulthood. Cheetahs are amazing. I hope you like cheetahs.

4,Do you have a favorite place to goâ€”a place with family  good weather  and fun things to do like crabbing? Im glad I do. New Jersey is my favorite place for many reasons. The first reason is my family. Over half of my family lives in New Jersey. When I visit  my cousins and I laugh and play all day and night. My uncles and aunts take me to the boardwalk where we ride roller coasters. We devour juicy caramel-covered apples and foot-long hot dogs. My family is fun to be with. The second reason for New Jersey being my favorite place is the weather. Instead of being hot and sweaty  its always cool and moist. When I think about my visits  I can just feel the crisp fall breeze in my hair. I can just see the white  fluffy winter snow. I can just hear the soft spring trickles of rain splashing on the sidewalks. I can just feel the warm summer sun on my face. The weather is great! The third reason for New Jersey being my favorite place is crabbing. If its crab season  we crab. We keep the blue crabs and the snow crabs  and we let the others go. Sometimes we catch crabs on hooks  and sometimes we lower crab cages into the bay. Then we pull them out later. One time my brother caught a crab so big that it got stuck in the crab cage! The crab finally got out  but it hurt one of its legs and broke the cage trying. Poor crab! For all these reasons  New Jersey is my favorite place to go. If you dont have a favorite place  I think you should search for one. Its good to visit a favorite placeâ€”a place where you can make special memories.

4,Do you have someone who is great  spends time with you  cares for you  and is an important person? Well  I do  and she has black hair  brown eyes  and a caring touch. Thats my mom. My mom talks to me about many things. One of the things she talks to me about is what will happen when I grow up. She tells me what to do in case of an emergency. And one day I had a really bad day with my friends  and she told me what to do about it. My mom and I spend a lot of time together. We play games  bake cookies  make necklaces  and draw doodle tricks. But our favorite thing to do is read. Our favorite book is If You Give a Mouse a Cookie. Mom takes me shopping at the mall. We buy toys and clothes  and we eat at the cafe. We usually get Chinese food or go to a McDonalds restaurant. When we ride the escalator  my mom pretends to fall back and says  My shoestrings stuck! My mom always laughs  and when she laughs she sounds like a hyena gone crazy! She doesnt laugh every day  but when she does  its hilarious  and I have to laugh  too! My mom is the greatest. I love how she jokes around. She is always fun no matter what  and she gives me great advice.

4,One day  on the way home from school  my mom told me she was going to make up some new rules for me and my brothers and sisters. Before this  we knew she wanted us to be good  but we really didnt have any rules. Well  Mom took care of that. On Sunday  she started giving us the house rules. Clean your rooms every other day. Be ready for dinner at 7:00 p.m. (that means sitting at the table  with clean hands). If Mom is having a meeting in the house  be very quiet (that means turn down the music and the TV). Be ready for bed at 9:30 p.m. (that means lying in bed  with clean faces). Get up at 7:30 a.m. to get ready for school (that means your feet are on the floor  not just hanging off the bed). Take the garbage cans to the curb on Monday morning before school. Clean the bathroom on Thursday. Following these rules isnt too hard  and sometimes its even fun. Other times  it can be tough. For instance  if your room is really dirty and you cant finish cleaning it on that day  you have to finish it on the next day  along with anything else you have to do. That can be hard. Mom made these rules because she loves us a lot. She wants us to learn how to be on time  be clean and neat  and be polite. Every day  we try to follow her rules.,one day on the way home from school my mom tell me she be go to make up some new rule for me and my brother and sister before this we know she want u to be good but we really didnt have any rule well mom take care of that on sunday she start give u the house rule clean your room every other day be ready for dinner at p m that mean sit at the table with clean hand if mom be have a meeting in the house be very quiet that mean turn down the music and the tv be ready for bed at p m that mean lie in bed with clean face get up at a m to get ready for school that mean your foot be on the floor not just hang off the bed take the garbage can to the curb on monday morning before school clean the bathroom on thursday follow these rule isnt too hard and sometimes it even fun other time it can be tough for instance if your room be really dirty and you cant finish cleaning it on that day you have to finish it on the next day along with anything else you have to do that can be hard mom make these rule because she love u a lot she want u to learn how to be on time be clean and neat and be polite every day we try to follow her rule,+ one day on the way home from school my mom told me she was going to make up some new rules for me and my brothers and sisters . + before this we knew she wanted us to be good but we really didnt have any rules . + well + mom took care of that . + on + sunday she started giving us the house rules . + clean your rooms every other day . + be ready for dinner at 7 : 00 p . m .

4,I have a place I love to go. Its a fort  or a clubhouse  where I can go with friends. We can hang out there  plan neat stuff  eat  and rest. Shadow Fort is my favorite place for lots of reasons. First of all  theres plenty of room for a few kids. Its large (gargantuan to me). The fort is 3 ft. 8 in. high  5 ft. 3 in. long  and 3 ft. 6 in. wide. Theres a place in back (we call it the pantry) for crackers  grapefruit  avacadoes  potatoes  carrots  berries  and Spanish moss. The roof is made of 4-ft. palm leaves and smaller fronds. Second  this fort is the first structure I ever built  with the help of my friend Kevin. We built it during a light shower. It was only a few vines that tangled together to make a kind of cave that we could crawl under. We worked fast to put palm fronds and leaves over the vines. Quick! Lets get inside! I shouted to Kevin. We got inside in the nick of time. It began to rain powerfully  and oh how the wind blew! But our fort kept us safe and dry. Later we named it Shadow Fort because it sits in a shady area. Finally  Shadow Fort is my favorite place because it has everything we need. We keep food in the pantry  a small cot to sit on  and we even have a plywood door. One time Kevin fell out of a tree and hurt his ankle. I helped him back to Shadow Fort where he rested on the cot. Then I made some dinnerâ€”crackers  carrots  and berries for dessert. Can you see why Shadow Fort is my favorite place? I hope so. When Im there  I feel happy as a cat with cream!,i have a place i love to go it a fort or a clubhouse where i can go with friend we can hang out there plan neat stuff eat and rest shadow fort be my favorite place for lot of reason first of all there plenty of room for a few kid it large gargantuan to me the fort be ft in high ft in long and ft in wide there a place in back we call it the pantry for cracker grapefruit avacadoes potato carrot berry and spanish moss the roof be make of ft palm leaf and small frond second this fort be the first structure i ever build with the help of my friend kevin we build it during a light shower it be only a few vine that tangle together to make a kind of cave that we could crawl under we work fast to put palm frond and leave over the vine quick let get inside i shout to kevin we get inside in the nick of time it begin to rain powerfully and oh how the wind blew but our fort keep u safe and dry later we name it shadow fort because it sit in a shady area finally shadow fort be my favorite place because it have everything we need we keep food in the pantry a small cot to sit on and we even have a plywood door one time kevin fell out of a tree and hurt his ankle i help him back to shadow fort where he rest on the cot then i make some dinner cracker carrot and berry for dessert can you see why shadow fort be my favorite place i hope so when im there i feel happy a a cat with cream,I have a place I love to go . + its a fort or a clubhouse where I can go with friends . + we can hang out there plan neat stuff eat and rest . + shadow + fort is my favorite place for lots of reasons . + first of all theres plenty of room for a few kids . + its large ( gargantuan to me ) . + the fort is 3 ft . 8 in . high 5 ft . 3 in . long and 3 ft . 6 in . wide . + theres a place in back ( we call it the pantry ) for crackers grapefruit avacadoes potatoes carrots berries and + spanish moss . + the roof is made of 4 - ft . palm leaves and smaller fronds . + second this fort is the first structure I ever built with the help of my friend + kevin . + we built it during a light shower . + it was only a few vines that tangled together to make a kind of cave that we could crawl under . + we worked fast to put palm fronds and leaves over the vines . + quick ! + lets get inside !

4,Owning a pet from the pound or Animal Rescue League has many advantages. First of all  a child feels good about rescuing an abandoned or abused animal and giving it a whole new life. Besides  if the animals from the pound arent adopted right away  they might be put to sleep. Having a pet also means lots of responsibilities. A child has to feed  clean up after  brush  and exercise the pet. Another great advantage of having a pet from the pound is the price of these cute and cuddly animals. Pets from the pound cost a lot less than pets at a fancy pet store  which can cost hundreds of dollars. Once you adopt a pet from the Animal Rescue League  it will quickly become a part of your family. If you are thinking of adopting a pet  you might consider choosing a dog or a cat. Dogs and cats can bring lots of happy times to a family  and they can be excellent companions for a person who lives alone or someone who has lost a loved one. Dogs are also a wonderful source of protection. Cats are funny  and they may help to calm people down when they are sad or mad. Please consider adopting an animal.

4,Dear Editor  Im writing to you about the Teacher-Who-Made-a-Difference contest. Ms. Wells made a difference to me! I think she should be the winner of your contest. Ms. Wells has done so much for me and for all of her students; this is the least I can do for her. First of all  Ms. Wells is helpful. Shes willing to help anyone in the classroom who needs help. My teacher always helps us with worksheets. On Friday  she showed me how to do something in math. If you ask her for help  shell help you. In addition  Ms. Wells is a kind person. She always lets her students stay in from recess. On February 26  she let our class have a Colonial Day. We got to dress up like colonists; it was a blast! Not only is she kind to kids  but shes also kind to other teachers and parents. She is always thoughtful and considerate. Lastly  Ms. Wells donates her time to kids. She donates her lunch recess for Student Council  which meets in her room. Last fall  Ms. Wells promised me that she would come to one of my soccer games. Guess what? She did  even though she had a lot of school stuff to correct and had to leave for Chicago. In conclusion  I think Ms. Wells should be the winner of your contest. She is helpful and kind and gives her free time to students. I know you will agree with me that Ms. Wells is a Teacher Who Made a Difference. Shes the best!

4,Do you have a friend who loves you? Well  I did. Her name was Ann. She was a very close friend of mine. She was almost like family to me. Ann was very kind  and she had bright blue eyes and curly gray hair. I loved her very much. She invited me to go swimming every summer. We had a lot of fun all those summers. But she could not get in the water most of the time because she was sick. Sometimes my sisters would come swimming  too. But it was better with just Ann and me because I just wanted to spend time with her. Ann always listened to me when I had a problem. She was always there for me when I needed help on homework or had problems at school. Sometimes she would let me come in her house  and she would give me something to eat. Most of the time it would be an orange and a soft drink. Last summer that all changed. Ann was diagnosed with cancer. Two weeks after Ann was diagnosed with cancer  she died. Her funeral was not too long after that. My mom did not let me go to the visitation at the funeral home or to the funeral ceremony. My heart broke. Ann was no longer there with me. Now  its been a year since Anns death  but I still dream about her. Now its hard without her. My whole life has changed without Ann  and I really miss her. I know that everywhere I go there will always be a spot in my heart for Ann!,do you have a friend who love you well i do her name be ann she be a very close friend of mine she be almost like family to me ann be very kind and she have bright blue eye and curly gray hair i love her very much she invite me to go swimming every summer we have a lot of fun all those summer but she could not get in the water most of the time because she be sick sometimes my sister would come swim too but it be well with just ann and me because i just want to spend time with her ann always listen to me when i have a problem she be always there for me when i need help on homework or have problem at school sometimes she would let me come in her house and she would give me something to eat most of the time it would be an orange and a soft drink last summer that all change ann be diagnose with cancer two week after ann be diagnose with cancer she die her funeral be not too long after that my mom do not let me go to the visitation at the funeral home or to the funeral ceremony my heart break ann be no long there with me now it be a year since anns death but i still dream about her now it hard without her my whole life have change without ann and i really miss her i know that everywhere i go there will always be a spot in my heart for ann,+ do you have a friend who loves you ? + well I did . + her name was + ann . + she was a very close friend of mine . + she was almost like family to me . + ann was very kind and she had bright blue eyes and curly gray hair .

4,It was a few months before my brother was born. My grandpa was perfectly fine  but then he went to the doctor for a checkup. The doctors found something wrong. They said they had to run some tests. Then they said he had colon cancer. The doctors wanted to run more tests  so Grandpa had to stay in the hospital for a while. After he got home  I played with him. He would always play with me and do all sorts of stuff. I loved my grandpa. I liked to hear him play his harmonica. He even tried to teach me how to play it. Then he had to go back to the hospital for surgery. He stayed there for a while. When he went back home  we went to his house. When we got there  my grandpa was lying on the couch. A couple of hours later  he died. I was scared  but I was only three years old. I was glad that I could see him and say good-bye. My grandpa died August 27  2009. Four months later  on December 31 2009  my brother Chaz was born. I wish Grandpa could have lived to see my brother. I really miss Grandpa  and so does my brother  even though he never met him.

4,I am going to tell you about my dog and how I got him. I dont remember exactly how it happened  but at some point my parents asked if I wanted to have a dog. I  of course  said yes. We couldnt decide what kind of dog to get at first  but at last we found a great breed  the Shetland sheepdog. We called a good breeder. I was so excited about getting a dog! Before I knew it  I was on my way to the breeder. I went inside and saw dogs everywhere. It was so hard to pick which one to get. I saw one I liked. It was a small blue merle. He looked perfect  so I asked if we could get him. It turned out that he was too young to sell. So I kept looking. When I finally decided on one  we were all very happy. It still took a few weeks until he was old enough to bring home. It seemed to take forever until the day came  but it did. It was so exciting. We were on our way to pick up our newest family member. When we went to pick him up  we realized that we had everything except the most important thing  a name! On our way home  we came up with what seemed like the perfect name: Indiana. This name came from his head coloring  believe it or not. His head was the same color as Indiana Joness hat. Like all dog names  it was shortened to Indy and eventually shortened to Ind. We loved Indy  yet it wasnt all fun and games. We had to make major adjustments for him. When he was young  we had to blockade parts of the house because they were too dangerous for him. Another reason we had to block things off was that Indy was not yet housebroken. We also had to move my cats food because Indy kept eating it. Finally  we had to build him a kennel. Yes  we had to make a lot of changes  but Indy has changed a lot since the day we got him. He is no longer a puppy  and he is housebroken! Now hes pretty much everyones buddy.

4,Have you ever run a business from a playhouse? My friends and I have. It is a bike shop. We call it Jet Bikes. One day my friend Trent asked me and my brother Jared if we wanted to build a bike shop out of his old playhouse. Jared and I said  Yes. So we went to get permission from my mom to go to Trents house and get started. The first thing we did was get some things out of his garage. We got old  rusty bolts; new  shiny nuts; black tape; wrenches; half-empty cans of oil; and screws. Then we built a new roof for the playhouse. We also had to clean the dirt and leaves out of it. So far weve only worked on our own bikes because not many people know about our shop. We had to fix Trents chain a few times. We also had to fix his tire because it would go flat every five minutes. We changed the inner tube and also used some stuff called No More Flats. Now it never goes flat! When we are older  we plan on putting signs up around town and maybe even have a Web site. We will work on bikes as big as 20 speeds and as small as bikes with training wheels. We hope to have a lot of customers. Do you think youll ever come here with a bike for my friends and me to work on? I hope so because it would be fun to have some customers  and it might be fun for you to have kids fix your bike!,have you ever run a business from a playhouse my friend and i have it be a bike shop we call it jet bike one day my friend trent ask me and my brother jar if we want to build a bike shop out of his old playhouse jar and i say yes so we go to get permission from my mom to go to trent house and get start the first thing we do be get some thing out of his garage we get old rusty bolt new shiny nut black tape wrench half empty can of oil and screw then we build a new roof for the playhouse we also have to clean the dirt and leave out of it so far weve only work on our own bike because not many people know about our shop we have to fix trent chain a few time we also have to fix his tire because it would go flat every five minute we change the inner tube and also use some stuff call no more flat now it never go flat when we be old we plan on put sign up around town and maybe even have a web site we will work on bike as big a speed and as small a bike with training wheel we hope to have a lot of customer do you think youll ever come here with a bike for my friend and me to work on i hope so because it would be fun to have some customer and it might be fun for you to have kid fix your bike,+ have you ever run a business from a playhouse ? + my friends and I have . + it is a bike shop . + we call it + jet + bikes . + one day my friend + trent asked me and my brother + jared if we wanted to build a bike shop out of his old playhouse . + jared and I said + yes . + so we went to get permission from my mom to go to + trents house and get started . + the first thing we did was get some things out of his garage . + we got old rusty bolts ; new shiny nuts ; black tape ; wrenches ; half - empty cans of oil ; and screws . + then we built a new roof for the playhouse . + we also had to clean the dirt and leaves out of it . + so far weve only worked on our own bikes because not many people know about our shop . + we had to fix + trents chain a few times . + we also had to fix his tire because it would go flat every five minutes . + we changed the inner tube and also used some stuff called + no + more + flats . + now it never goes flat ! + when we are older we plan on putting signs up around town and maybe even have a + web site . + we will work on bikes as big as 20 speeds and as small as bikes with training wheels . + we hope to have a lot of customers . + do you think youll ever come here with a bike for my friends and me to work on ?

4,Wouldnt it be superb to have one moment when you took the spotlight  to have everybody clapping for you and cheering loudly? I have had that once-in-a-lifetime opportunityâ€”the day I took the spotlight! Sometime in February  my teacher told us all about the Woodmen of America speech contest. The topic was people who have overcome obstacles in their lives. I thought my great-grandma Lorraine Parsley  who has had recurring cancer 13 times and is still living  would be perfect. She has overcome a lot of obstacles in her life. A couple weeks later  the class gave their presentations. My teacher had to pick three to five students to go on to the next level. I was one of them! Then the top five from each of the three fifth-grade classes competed. The top seven would be the finalists; again  I was one of them! The top seven worked really hard. We had until March 15 2001  to practice. March 15 rolled around. Before I knew it  I was in our school gym with people all around  including the judges  listening to every word I said. I was the sixth to present. I was soon done; what a relief! I knew the top seven got ribbons  certificates  and pins; but I still wanted that trophy. After the seventh person finished  the judges made their final decisions. They announced the winners. The third-place winner was Aunum  the second-place winner was Sarah  and the first-place winner was Kelli! I had just won first place! I was ecstatic. That was my once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

4,Brian Robeson was stopped and stricken with a white flash of horror  a terror so intense that his breathing  his thinking  and his heart had nearly stopped. This quote from the book Hatchet by Gary Paulsen shows why this book was too good to put down. Brian Robeson  an eleven-year-old boy  left his home in New York to go to Canada to see his father. He was on a plane (a two-person plane) in the middle of the Canadian forest when the pilot had a heart attack. Brian was stranded in the air with no real knowledge of how to fly a plane. Brian had to make the BIGGEST decision of his life: whether to keep flying or just let the plane drop. If he let it drop  the only weapon he had was a hatchet. I feel that the author of this book  Gary Paulsen  is trying to tell his readers  If you believe in yourself  you can survive on your own. I really liked this book because it sounded like it could really happen. I enjoy books like that  and Id recommend this book to anyone. Also  as I said  it kept me reading. I couldnt put it down until I found out what was going to happen to Brian.,brian robeson be stop and stricken with a white flash of horror a terror so intense that his breathe his thinking and his heart have nearly stop this quote from the book hatchet by gary paulsen show why this book be too good to put down brian robeson an eleven year old boy leave his home in new york to go to canada to see his father he be on a plane a two person plane in the middle of the canadian forest when the pilot have a heart attack brian be strand in the air with no real knowledge of how to fly a plane brian have to make the big decision of his life whether to keep fly or just let the plane drop if he let it drop the only weapon he have be a hatchet i feel that the author of this book gary paulsen be try to tell his reader if you believe in yourself you can survive on your own i really like this book because it sound like it could really happen i enjoy book like that and id recommend this book to anyone also a i say it keep me read i couldnt put it down until i find out what be go to happen to brian,+ brian + robeson was stopped and stricken with a white flash of horror a terror so intense that his breathing his thinking and his heart had nearly stopped . + this quote from the book + hatchet by + gary + paulsen shows why this book was too good to put down . + brian + robeson an eleven - year - old boy left his home in + new + york to go to + canada to see his father . + he was on a plane ( a two - person plane ) in the middle of the + canadian forest when the pilot had a heart attack . + brian was stranded in the air with no real knowledge of how to fly a plane . + brian had to make the + biggest decision of his life : whether to keep flying or just let the plane drop . + if he let it drop the only weapon he had was a hatchet .

4,The first thing I do when I wake up is lick myself with my pink  scratchy tongue. Then I get up and stretch. First I stretch my front legs  then I stretch my back legs. Next  I go wake up Erins mom by scratching on her door. Sometimes she sprays me with a squirt bottle filled with water to stop me  but mostly she gives me my favorite smelly salmon cat food with medicine in it. Then I sleep until lunch. When I wake up again  my stomach is growling  so I meow for more food. Usually Erins mom gives me more  but sometimes she tells me to go eat my hard  dry cat food. After lunch  I look out the patio door for birds  chipmunks  and squirrels. Sometimes  if Im lucky  a chipmunk comes to the door and says hi. Then I lunge at the window to say hello back  but he scurries away with his tail up in the air. Next  I go into the den and lie on the floor for a rest. Then I notice a fuzzy twitching thing right next to me  and I start to chase it. After people start laughing at me  I realize that it is my own tail! After all that  I go into the living room and sleep again. When I wake up  it is supper time  and I am hungry. I want to eat again. Erin or her mom serves me some more scrumptious  smelly salmon cat food. Ahh! That tastes good. Then its time to go outside. I have an exciting time avoiding the sly coyotes and chasing after little night creatures. Finally  Erins dad opens the door to let me in. I go to Erins bed and sleep the rest of the night.

4,As your eyes flutter and your breathing slows  Teddy bear clasped in your hand  You hop on a beautiful train To a mystical  enchanted land. You step down on cloud steps And think  Is this actually real? Your breathing stops  and your eyes pop open; Shock is what you feel.

They dance on and onâ€” Forever  it seems. You can ride on an eagle  You can wish on a star  And joy fills your body Wherever you are. Then you hear the sound of a rooster; It says you have to go.

4,Have you ever been trick-or-treating when you came upon an old house and wanted to explore it? Well  Ill tell you a story about five kids  Jake  Zach  John  Bob  and Sean  who did it. They were trick-or-treating in their neighborhood  going door-to-door  when they came upon an old house. Lets go in  Sean said. Everybody said they would. They started up the walk. The grass was overgrown  and there were a couple of broken windows. They got to the door  and it opened by itself. They went inside. They had flashlights with them  so they turned them on. The house was covered in cobwebs. They saw a sign that said  Beware  and it was pointing up to the second floor. They decided to go upstairs. When they got there  they saw a hallway with three rooms. One room had an old bed and a dresser. The second room was a bathroom. The third room was a sitting room. When they entered the third room  someone said  Hello. All the boys screamed and ran downstairs. When they were at the door  the voice said  Dont you guys want some candy? They turned around and saw a man with candy standing in the hallway. They ran as fast as they could to Bobs house. When they got there  they described the man to Bobs mom. She said  That sounds like Mr. Craig. He lived there when I was a kid  but he died 30 years ago.,have you ever be trick or treat when you come upon an old house and want to explore it well ill tell you a story about five kid jake zach john bob and sean who do it they be trick or treat in their neighborhood go door to door when they come upon an old house let go in sean say everybody say they would they start up the walk the grass be overgrow and there be a couple of broken window they get to the door and it open by itself they go inside they have flashlight with them so they turn them on the house be cover in cobweb they saw a sign that say beware and it be point up to the second floor they decide to go upstairs when they get there they saw a hallway with three room one room have an old bed and a dresser the second room be a bathroom the third room be a sitting room when they enter the third room someone say hello all the boy scream and run downstairs when they be at the door the voice say dont you guy want some candy they turn around and saw a man with candy stand in the hallway they run as fast a they could to bob house when they get there they describe the man to bob mom she say that sound like mr craig he live there when i be a kid but he die year ago,+ have you ever been trick - or - treating when you came upon an old house and wanted to explore it ? + well + ill tell you a story about five kids + jake + zach + john + bob and + sean who did it . + they were trick - or - treating in their neighborhood going door - to - door when they came upon an old house . + lets go in + sean said . + everybody said they would . + they started up the walk . + the grass was overgrown and there were a couple of broken windows . + they got to the door and it opened by itself . + they went inside . + they had flashlights with them so they turned them on . + the house was covered in cobwebs . + they saw a sign that said + beware and it was pointing up to the second floor . + they decided to go upstairs . + when they got there they saw a hallway with three rooms . + one room had an old bed and a dresser . + the second room was a bathroom . + the third room was a sitting room . + when they entered the third room someone said + hello . + all the boys screamed and ran downstairs . + when they were at the door the voice said + dont you guys want some candy ? + they turned around and saw a man with candy standing in the hallway . + they ran as fast as they could to + bobs house . + when they got there they described the man to + bobs mom . + she said + that sounds like + mr . + craig . + he lived there when I was a kid but he died 30 years ago . 
4,It was 1:00 a.m. on a warm spring Wednesday  and it was storming outside. Casey was sleeping in her bed when she was awakened by a loud blast. It was the tornado siren. Just then her parents rushed in and said  Grab your pillow and one thing you want to save! She decided to grab her dog  who was sleeping in her room. Most of her other things she could replace  but she couldnt replace a living thing. Then she heard a loud crash and ran downstairs with the trembling dog in her arms. When they were all downstairs  they started listening to the weather radio. The weatherman said that an F5 tornado was heading straight for Silver Lake Trailer Park  and  unfortunately  thats where Casey lived. Soon Casey could hear the loud rumbling noise of her house being thrown this way and that. The basement door was shaking like a giant was trying to get it open. She put the pillow over her head and tried to forget what was happening. Many of Caseys things were blown awayâ€”her bed  her dresser  her bookshelf  her books  and the painting her grandma had given her.

4,Have you ever been in trouble and wanted to get away? The white-tailed deer can swim  run  hide  and fight to stay out of trouble. If you want to know how they do it  read on. In early April  fawns (baby deer) are born. After a few weeks  the doe (the mother deer) leaves her fawns to find food. The doe leaves her fawns in a bushy place. The trees and grass can help keep the fawns from being seen by hungry predators. The white-tailed deer has many predators  such as these: mountain lions  bobcats  leopards  lions  dogs  bears  tigers  coyotes  wolves  and even humans. The fawns camouflage hides them in Aprils trees and golden grasses. In spring  the fawns fur is brown with white spots. In summer  the fawns white spots disappear and never come back. In winter  their fur is gray  which helps them hide in the snow. When the deer see  smell  or hear something suspicious  they stick their white tails up to signal that danger is near. The leader will run  and the others will follow. When a deer is chased to water  it knows what to do. The deer will win this battle. The deer runs into the water and swims to the deepest part. If the predator thinks its going to win the battle  it is wrong. The deer will kick and thrash until the predator drowns or walks off wounded. If a deer is in a wide-open field and notices a predator  it will run zigzag to get away. It runs zigzag to confuse the predator. If the deer ran straight  it could become a venison feast. There is one more way that deer stay out of trouble. Bucks fight with weapons called antlers. These are different from horns because they are attached to the skull  and horns are not. Antlers are made of bone and have vitamins in them. The deer can use its antlers to protect itself. Deer stay safe by hiding  swimming  running  and fighting. Whenever you see a deer raise its tail  you know that it has seen a predator.,have you ever be in trouble and want to get away the white tailed deer can swim run hide and fight to stay out of trouble if you want to know how they do it read on in early april fawn baby deer be bear after a few week the doe the mother deer leave her fawn to find food the doe leave her fawn in a bushy place the tree and grass can help keep the fawn from be see by hungry predator the white tailed deer have many predator such a these mountain lion bobcats leopard lion dog bear tiger coyotes wolf and even humans the fawns camouflage hide them in april tree and golden grass in spring the fawn fur be brown with white spot in summer the fawn white spot disappear and never come back in winter their fur be gray which help them hide in the snow when the deer see smell or hear something suspicious they stick their white tail up to signal that danger be near the leader will run and the others will follow when a deer be chase to water it know what to do the deer will win this battle the deer run into the water and swim to the deep part if the predator think it go to win the battle it be wrong the deer will kick and thrash until the predator drowns or walk off wound if a deer be in a wide open field and notice a predator it will run zigzag to get away it run zigzag to confuse the predator if the deer run straight it could become a venison feast there be one more way that deer stay out of trouble buck fight with weapon call antler these be different from horn because they be attach to the skull and horn be not antler be make of bone and have vitamin in them the deer can use it antler to protect itself deer stay safe by hide swim running and fight whenever you see a deer raise it tail you know that it have see a predator,+ have you ever been in trouble and wanted to get away ? + the white - tailed deer can swim run hide and fight to stay out of trouble . + if you want to know how they do it read on . + in early + april fawns ( baby deer ) are born . + after a few weeks the doe ( the mother deer ) leaves her fawns to find food . + the doe leaves her fawns in a bushy place . + the trees and grass can help keep the fawns from being seen by hungry predators . + the white - tailed deer has many predators such as these : mountain lions bobcats leopards lions dogs bears tigers coyotes wolves and even humans . + the fawns camouflage hides them in + aprils trees and golden grasses . + in spring the fawns fur is brown with white spots . + in summer the fawns white spots disappear and never come back . + in winter their fur is gray which helps them hide in the snow . + when the deer see smell or hear something suspicious they stick their white tails up to signal that danger is near . + the leader will run and the others will follow . + when a deer is chased to water it knows what to do . + the deer will win this battle . + the deer runs into the water and swims to the deepest part . + if the predator thinks its going to win the battle it is wrong . + the deer will kick and thrash until the predator drowns or walks off wounded . + if a deer is in a wide - open field and notices a predator it will run zigzag to get away . + it runs zigzag to confuse the predator . + if the deer ran straight it could become a venison feast . + there is one more way that deer stay out of trouble . + bucks fight with weapons called antlers . + these are different from horns because they are attached to the skull and horns are not . + antlers are made of bone and have vitamins in them . + the deer can use its antlers to protect itself . + deer stay safe by hiding swimming running and fighting . + whenever you see a deer raise its tail you know that it has seen a predator . 
4,Have you ever seen a dog with big ears and short legs? Was it so irresistibly cute you just wanted to take it home? Chances are  you were looking at a Pembroke Welsh corgi. Let me introduce you to a dog of very high intelligence. Since Welsh corgis are so intelligent  they are easy to train. One of the jobs they are good at is herding sheep and cattle. Welsh corgis are also very loyal companions for people of all ages. The Welsh corgis small size means it doesnt take up much room as a pet. Its average height is 10-12 inches  and an adult dog weighs approximately 25-30 pounds. Welsh corgis were originally bred in Wales. They come in several colors: red  sable  fawn  or black and tan  with or without white markings. Their coats are a medium length  and they need to be groomed and exercised regularly to stay healthy. The corgis life span is 12 to 14 years. Welsh corgis are known for being bold but kind  friendly  and alert. They are friendly to all  good with children  and rarely aggressive. Next time you see a dog that looks like a German shepherd in the front seat of a car  look again. It may be a dog with a full-sized body and half-sized legsâ€”not a height-challenged German shepherd. When it hops out  you might just drop your jaw.,have you ever see a dog with big ear and short leg be it so irresistibly cute you just want to take it home chance be you be look at a pembroke welsh corgi let me introduce you to a dog of very high intelligence since welsh corgi be so intelligent they be easy to train one of the job they be good at be herd sheep and cattle welsh corgi be also very loyal companion for people of all age the welsh corgi small size mean it doesnt take up much room a a pet it average height be inch and an adult dog weigh approximately pounds welsh corgi be originally breed in wale they come in several color red sable fawn or black and tan with or without white marking their coat be a medium length and they need to be groom and exercise regularly to stay healthy the corgis life span be to year welsh corgi be know for be bold but kind friendly and alert they be friendly to all good with child and rarely aggressive next time you see a dog that look like a german shepherd in the front seat of a car look again it may be a dog with a full size body and half size legs not a height challenged german shepherd when it hop out you might just drop your jaw,+ have you ever seen a dog with big ears and short legs ? + was it so irresistibly cute you just wanted to take it home ? + chances are you were looking at a + pembroke + welsh corgi . + let me introduce you to a dog of very high intelligence . + since + welsh corgis are so intelligent they are easy to train . + one of the jobs they are good at is herding sheep and cattle . + welsh corgis are also very loyal companions for people of all ages . + the + welsh corgis small size means it doesnt take up much room as a pet . + its average height is 10 - 12 inches and an adult dog weighs approximately 25 - 30 pounds . + welsh corgis were originally bred in + wales . + they come in several colors : red sable fawn or black and tan with or without white markings . + their coats are a medium length and they need to be groomed and exercised regularly to stay healthy . + the corgis life span is 12 to 14 years . + welsh corgis are known for being bold but kind friendly and alert . + they are friendly to all good with children and rarely aggressive . + next time you see a dog that looks like a + german shepherd in the front seat of a car look again . + it may be a dog with a full - sized body and half - sized legsnot a height - challenged + german shepherd . + when it hops out you might just drop your jaw . 
6,A dictionary contains a definition of friendship somewhere in the Fs between the words fear and Friday. An encyclopedia supplies interesting facts on friendship. But all the definitions and facts do not convey what friendship is really all about. It cannot be understood through words or exaggerations. The only way to understand friendship is through experience. It is an experience that involves all the senses. Friendship can be seen. It is seen in an old couple sitting in the park holding hands. It is the way they touch  a touch as light as a leaf floating in the autumn air  a touch so strong that years of living could not pull them apart. Friendship is seen in a child freely sharing the last cookie. It is the small arm over the shoulder of another as they walk on the playground. Seeing friendship is not casual. It is watching for subtlety  but friendship is there for eyes that can see. Friendship can be heard. It is heard in the words of two friends who squeezed in lunch together on an extremely busy day. It is the way they talk to each other  not the words. Their tone is unique. Friendship can be heard by those willing to listen. Friendship is felt in a touch. It is a pat on the back from a teammate  a high five between classes  the slimy  wet kiss from the family dog. Its a touch that reassures that someone is there  someone who cares. The touch communicates more than words or gestures. It is instantly understood and speaks volumes beyond the point of contact  to the heart. Friendship has a taste. It tastes like homemade bread  the ingredients all measured and planned  then carefully mixed and kneaded  then the quiet waiting as the dough rises. Hot from the oven  the bread tastes more than the sum of its ingredients. There is something else there  perhaps the thoughts of the baker as her hands knead the dough  or her patience as she waits for the dough to rise. Unseen and unmeasured  this is the ingredient that makes the difference. Warm  fresh from the oven with a little butter  the difference you taste is friendship. Friendship has a smell. It smells like the slightly burnt cookies your brother made especially for you. It smells like your home when stepping into it after being away for a long time. It smells like a sandbox or a sweaty gym. Friendship has a variety of smells. Taken for granted at the moment  they define the memory of friendship. Finally  more than the other senses  friendship is an experience of the heart. It is the language of the heartâ€”a language without words  vowels  or consonants; a language that  whether seen  felt  heard  or tasted  is understood by the heart. Like air fills the lungs  friendship fills the heart  allowing us to experience the best life has to offer: a friend.,a dictionary contain a definition of friendship somewhere in the f between the

6,Margaret L. is like any other teenage girl today: she talks on the phone  deals with the stress of schoolwork  and has a boyfriend. Unlike many of her peers  however  Margaret takes medication as part of her morning routine; and the time she spends in the school bathroom is not devoted to fixing her hair. Margaret has spina bifida  a condition in which one or more of her vertebrae did not form properly  leaving her spinal cordâ€”the most vital component of the central nervous systemâ€”unprotected. She has had eight operations and wears braces on her legs to keep them in the proper positions. Throughout all of these ordeals  she has retained her outgoing personality and positive view of life. The 14-year-old attends high school and is not in any special classes. She is allowed extra time to get to class when she needs it. She says  I get it [teased] a lot  but I do have a small group of friends who are great about everything. Margaret has had the support of her parents as well: I think that  growing up with a disability  the best thing that I have had is supportive parents; without them I dont know where I would be. They both have always said that I could do something if I really wanted to. After school on most days  Margaret works at Able-Disabled Advocacy (A-DA)  an organization that helps the disabled  alongside her mother  Cindy. On other days she plays wheelchair basketball and tennis  even though she is not wheelchair-bound herself. Her evenings are spent at A-DA and doing schoolwork  such as the recent project on a genetic medical condition for which she selected spina bifida as her topic. Margaret met her first serious boyfriend  Juan  when they played against each other during a wheelchair basketball tournament. We were complete enemies on the court  she says. They met again at a Spina Bifida Association conference. They danced together twice. Later she realized the special connection they shared  both having a disability. Margaret feels that  far from having limited her  her disability has allowed her to do things she might not have been able to do otherwise. She says that she would not have been involved in sports at all if it was not for wheelchair sports  and she would not have some of her current friendships or her boyfriend. Rock climbing  cycling  and downhill racing (a kind of cycling) are some of the other activities she is able to participate in. Margaret also volunteers in an inclusion program at a Jewish community center  helping other kids with disabilities. The prognosis  or outlook  for most people with spina bifida is excellent  and Margaret is thinking about the future. I want to be a doctor of some kind  she says  though Im not sure what kind yet.,margaret l be like any other teenage girl today she talk on the phone deal with the stress of schoolwork and have a boyfriend unlike many of her peer however margaret take medication a part of her morning routine and the time she spend in the school bathroom be not devote to fix her hair margaret have spina bifida a condition in which one or more of her vertebra do not form properly leave her spinal cord the most vital component of the central nervous system unprotected she have have eight operation and wear brace on her leg to keep them in the proper position throughout all of these ordeal she have retain her outgoing personality and positive view of life the year old attend high school and be not in any special class she be allow extra time to get to class when she need it she say i get it tease a lot but i do have a small group of friend who be great about everything margaret have have the support of her parent a well i think that grow up with a disability the best thing that i have have be supportive parent without them i dont know where i would be they both have always say that i could do something if i really want to after school on most day margaret work at able disabled advocacy a da an organization that help the disabled alongside her mother cindy on other day she play wheelchair basketball and tennis even though she be not wheelchair bound herself her evening be spend at a da and do schoolwork such a the recent project on a genetic medical condition for which she select spina bifida a her topic margaret meet her first serious boyfriend juan when they play against each other during a wheelchair basketball tournament we be complete enemy on the court she say they meet again at a spina bifida association conference they dance together twice later she realize the special connection they share both have a disability margaret feel that far from have limited her her disability have allow her to do thing she might not have be able to do otherwise she say that she would not have be involve in sport at all if it be not for wheelchair sport and she would not have some of her current friendship or her boyfriend rock climb cycling and downhill race a kind of cycling be some of the other activity she be able to participate in margaret also volunteer in an inclusion program at a jewish community center help other kid with disability the prognosis or outlook for most people with spina bifida be excellent and margaret be think about the future i want to be a doctor of some kind she say though im not sure what kind yet,+ margaret L . is like any other teenage girl today : she talks on the phone deals with the stress of schoolwork and has a boyfriend . + unlike many of her peers however + margaret takes medication as part of her morning routine ;

6,Did you know that 7 out of 10 students have cheated at least once in the past year? Did you know that 50 percent of those students have cheated more than twice? These shocking statistics are from a survey of 9 000 U.S. high school students. Incredibly  teachers may even be encouraging their students to cheat! Last year at a school in Detroit  teachers allegedly provided their students with answers to statewide standard tests. Students at the school told investigators that they were promised pizza and money if they cheated on the test as told. Similar allegations at several schools in San Diego county have prompted investigation. A student at a local high school says she sees students cheating on almost every test  and the teachers dont do anything about it. The kids claim that theyre tempted to cheat because of peer pressure and intense competition to get top grades. Many kids also say that their parents are setting a bad example by fudging on income taxes  lying about age to pay lower admission prices  or cheating their way out of a speeding ticket. They are sending a message to their kids that it is okay to cheat and lie. Finding solutions to this problem is difficult. In our schools math classes  each student has different problems on their test papers  so it is useless to look at someone elses answers. Teachers could also randomly mix the problems throughout the page. Another solution is for adults to lower their expectations. Chances are that students believe cheating is the only way to meet unreasonably high expectations. Perhaps it is time for parents and teachers to seriously examine whether higher test results are important enough to encourage cheating.,do you know that out of student have cheat at least once in the past year do you know that percent of those student have cheat more than twice these shock statistic be from a survey of u s high school student incredibly teacher may even be encourage their student to cheat last year at a school in detroit teacher allegedly provide their student with answer to statewide standard test student at the school tell investigator that they be promise pizza and money if they cheat on the test a tell similar allegation at several school in san diego county have prompt investigation a student at a local high school say she see student cheat on almost every test and the teacher dont do anything about it the kid claim that theyre tempt to cheat because of peer pressure and intense competition to get top grade many kid also say that their parent be set a bad example by fudge on income tax lie about age to pay low admission price or cheat their way out of a speed ticket they be send a message to their kid that it be okay to cheat and lie find solution to this problem be difficult in our school math class each student have different problem on their test paper so it be useless to look at someone elses answer teacher could also randomly mix the problem throughout the page another solution be for adult to lower their expectation chance be that student believe cheating be the only way to meet unreasonably high expectation perhaps it be time for parent and teacher to seriously examine whether high test result be important enough to encourage cheating,+ did you know that 7 out of 10 students have cheated at least once in the past year ? + did you know that 50 percent of those students have cheated more than twice ? + these shocking statistics are from a survey of 9 000 U .

6,You see it every day  especially in freeway traffic. A car is weaving back and forth  speeding up then slowing down  or suddenly stopping. No  its not a drunk driver. Its a cell-phone driver. Cell phones are used everywhere  but on the road they are a dangerous distraction to drivers and should be prohibited. The New England Journal of Medicine reported that motorists using a cell phone were four times more likely to have an accident than those not using a phone. The major problem is that the driver is not focused on the road  but on his or her conversation. Cell-phone drivers are very unpredictable: they weave  tailgate  drive too fast or too slow  make improper turns  run red lights  and even stop at green ones. Its not only annoying; its hazardous. Cell-phone-related accidents include rear-ending vehicles; running off a road and crashing into trees  fences  and buildings; flipping over; and having head-on collisions. Many of these accidents result in fatalities. In October at the California Traffic Safety Summit  experts testified that cell phones used by drivers lead to at least 1 000 deaths per year in California. These are the same problems that occur with drunk driving  which is strictly outlawed and harshly enforced. For the same reasons  California needs laws that restrict the use of cell phones in cars. Until we take action to pass new laws  drivers at least need to be more responsible when using cell phones. The American Automobile Association recommends that drivers pull off the road before using a cell phone  have a passenger use it for them  or use voice mail to answer calls. Another suggestion is to keep the phone off while moving or simply not use it in the car. Before using a cell phone  drivers should think to themselves  Is this call really that important?

6,Fine arts are important in the curriculum because of what they do for learning  stated Patty Taylor  arts consultant for the California State Department of Education. In other words  the arts  especially music  should be part of every schools curriculum at every grade level. Music makes students smarter  gives children something positive to do  and builds self-confidence. Most students dont have a chance to learn music outside of school  and everyone deserves that opportunity. Students would be much smarter if they had some music experience. They would improve their classroom skills  like paying attention  following directions  and participating without interrupting. People develop all these skills when they learn music. Musicians are also better in math  and they get higher S.A.T. scores. For instance  a study by the College Entrance Examination Board reported  Students with 20 units of arts and music scored 128 points higher on the S.A.T. verbal and 118 points higher in math. A Rockefeller Foundation study states that music majors have the highest rate of admittance to medical school. Making music also lets children use their imaginations  unlike playing with video games and electronic stuffed animals. It provides students a chance to try out their own ideas  according to the California Educator. Music makes children well-rounded students. Music not only makes children better students but also gives them something positive to do. In a music program  children can be part of a band or choir instead of getting into trouble. Parents can enjoy listening to their childrens music instead of seeing them glued to a computer or TV screen. In band  students get to be part of a team. They can interact with old friends and make new friends through music. In fact  on her Web site The Musicians Brain  Lois Svard explains how music stimulates mirror neurons  which synchronize performers but also help them empathize with each other. As the great choral conductor Eric Whitacre said  directing a choir is all about getting a room of people to breathe together. In many ways  music helps people connect. Music builds self-confidence. It gives children a sense of accomplishment and success. Making music is something for them to be proud of  and it lets kids practice performing in front of an audience. As reported in the California Educator  It gives [students] self-confidence and a feeling of importance to have a skill someone appreciates. They are also learning how to accomplish something from beginning to end and actually come out with a product that they can be proud of. Music gives children an outlet for self-expression  and that helps develop their self-confidence. Once again  music is important because it can make children better students  give them something positive to do  and build their character. Unfortunately  the children who need music lessons the most usually dont have access to them outside of school. That is why music should be offered in every single grade in every school.,fine art be important in the curriculum because of what they do for learn state patty taylor art consultant for the california state department of education in other word the art especially music should be part of every school curriculum at every grade level music make student smart give child something positive to do and build self confidence most student dont have a chance to learn music outside of school and everyone deserve that opportunity student would be much smart if they have some music experience they would improve their classroom skill like pay attention follow direction and participate without interrupt people develop all these skill when they learn music musician be also well in math and they get high s a t score for instance a study by the college entrance examination board report student with unit of art and music score point higher on the s a t verbal and point higher in math a rockefeller foundation study state that music major have the high rate of admittance to medical school making music also let child use their imagination unlike play with video game and electronic stuffed animal it provide student a chance to try out their own idea accord to the california educator music make child well rounded student music not only make child well student but also give them something positive to do in a music program child can be part of a band or choir instead of get into trouble parent can enjoy listen to their childrens music instead of see them glue to a computer or tv screen in band student get to be part of a team they can interact with old friend and make new friend through music in fact on her web site the musician brain lois svard explain how music stimulate mirror neuron which synchronize performer but also help them empathize with each other a the great choral conductor eric whitacre say direct a choir be all about get a room of people to breathe together in many way music help people connect music build self confidence it give child a sense of accomplishment and success making music be something for them to be proud of and it let kid practice perform in front of an audience a report in the california educator it give student self confidence and a feeling of importance to have a skill someone appreciate they be also learn how to accomplish something from begin to end and actually come out with a product that they can be proud of music give child an outlet for self expression and that help develop their self confidence once again music be important because it can make child good student give them something positive to do and build their character unfortunately the child who need music lessons the most usually dont have access to them outside of school that be why music should be offer in every single grade in every school,+ fine arts are important in the curriculum because of what they do for learning stated + patty + taylor arts consultant for the + california + state + department of + education . + in other words the arts especially music should be part of every schools curriculum at every grade level . + music makes students smarter gives children something positive to do and builds self - confidence . + most students dont have a chance to learn music outside of school and everyone deserves that opportunity . + students would be much smarter if they had some music experience . + they would improve their classroom skills like paying attention following directions and participating without interrupting . + people develop all these skills when they learn music . + musicians are also better in math and they get higher S .

6,The final bell rings. Its the last day of school  and summer has finally come! Students dont have to think about school for at least another 2 1/2 months. That is the way it should always be. Schools should continue using the traditional calendar and not a year-round schedule. There are numerous downsides to year-round schooling. It has no positive effects on education  it adds to costs  and it disrupts the long-awaited summer vacation. Contrary to the well-accepted belief  year-round schooling has no constructive impact on education. Most year-round schedules use the 45-15 method: 45 days of school followed by 15 days off. Because of this  there are many first and last days of school. All those transitions disrupt the learning process. Also  there is no evidence of higher test scores. Due to that  many schools that change to year-round schedules end up switching back. For example  since 1980  95 percent of schools that tried the year-round schedule changed back to a traditional calendar. It is obvious that changing to year-round schooling does not help students; therefore  why is the change necessary? Like any other facility  keeping a school open requires a great deal of money. When a school changes to a year-round schedule  the costs skyrocket. Keeping school open in the middle of summer requires air conditioning  and that adds significantly to the schools expenses. The usual utility bills grow because of the additional open-school time. Finally  teachers must be paid for all the weeks they are working. With all these factors  the cost of keeping schools open becomes immensely high. For example  a high school in Arizona had a cost increase of $157 000 when they switched to year-round schooling. Some schools may not be able to handle such increases  and other schools that can handle these expenses could be doing better things with the money. Is year-round school really where the money should go? An important part of a childs life is summertime. With year-round schedules  students would hardly have any time to relax. During the 15-day breaks  they would be thinking about their quick return to school. It would also be difficult to coordinate family vacations with parents work schedules. Similarly  children would not be able to go to most summer camps. One expert  Dr. Peter Scales  says  The biggest plus of camp is that camps help young people discover and explore their talents  interests  and values. Most schools dont satisfy all these needs. Kids who have these kinds of [camp] experiences end up being healthier and have fewer problems. Obviously  the summer is crucial to a childs learning and development. Why should this invaluable part of a young persons life be taken away? It is evident that year-round schooling is not the best option for the school calendar. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the traditional school year. Why change something that works so well? The final bell rings. Lets make sure this bell means that the real summer vacation has come.,the final bell ring it the last day of school and summer have finally come student dont have to think about school for at least another month that be the way it should always be school should continue use the traditional calendar and not a year round schedule there be numerous downside to year round school it have no positive effect on education it add to cost and it disrupt the long awaited summer vacation contrary to the well accept belief year round schooling have no constructive impact on education most year round schedule use the method day of school follow by day off because of this there be many first and last day of school all those transition disrupt the learning process also there be no evidence of high test score due to that many school that change to year round schedule end up switch back for example since percent of school that try the year round schedule change back to a traditional calendar it be obvious that change to year round schooling do not help student therefore why be the change necessary like any other facility keep a school open require a great deal of money when a school change to a year round schedule the cost skyrocket keep school open in the middle of summer require air conditioning and that add significantly to the school expense the usual utility bill grow because of the additional open school time finally teacher must be pay for all the week they be work with all these factor the cost of keep school open becomes immensely high for example a high school in arizona have a cost increase of when they switch to year round school some school may not be able to handle such increase and other school that can handle these expense could be do good thing with the money be year round school really where the money should go an important part of a childs life be summertime with year round schedule student would hardly have any time to relax during the day break they would be think about their quick return to school it would also be difficult to coordinate family vacation with parent work schedule similarly child would not be able to go to most summer camp one expert dr peter scale say the big plus of camp be that camp help young people discover and explore their talent interest and value most school dont satisfy all these need kid who have these kind of camp experience end up be healthy and have few problem obviously the summer be crucial to a child learn and development why should this invaluable part of a young person life be take away it be evident that year round schooling be not the best option for the school calendar there be absolutely nothing wrong with the traditional school year why change something that work so well the final bell ring let make sure this bell mean that the real summer vacation have come,+ the final bell rings . + its the last day of school and summer has finally come ! + students dont have to think about school for at least another 2 1 / 2 months . + that is the way it should always be . + schools should continue using the traditional calendar and not a year - round schedule . + there are numerous downsides to year - round schooling . + it has no positive effects on education it adds to costs and it disrupts the long - awaited summer vacation . + contrary to the well - accepted belief year - round schooling has no constructive impact on education . + most year - round schedules use the 45 - 15 method : 45 days of school followed by 15 days off . + because of this there are many first and last days of school . + all those transitions disrupt the learning process . + also there is no evidence of higher test scores . + due to that many schools that change to year - round schedules end up switching back . + for example since 1980 95 percent of schools that tried the year - round schedule changed back to a traditional calendar . + it is obvious that changing to year - round schooling does not help students ; therefore why is the change necessary ?

6,I am so upset at myself. I dont know where my head was. Finally  here I was  with $80 to my name (which is meager compensation for a two-month cattle drive)  and then I lose it all gambling. Just one night  and now I am bankrupt all over again. Yesterday was my 22nd birthday  as well as my payday  so I allowed myself a little gambling in Abilene  Kansas  a cow town. But I got so caught up in the action that I couldnt stop  and pretty soon  I was broke. I had been hoping to save enough money to start my own business  Bronco Jones and Company  but I suppose that will just have to wait for the next cattle drive. Hopefully  by then I will have better sense. But enough talk about that. I shall write about the cattle drive  in case I ever look back in this journal 20 years from now and wonder what it was like. Cowhands have very tough jobs  not to mention boring at times. I am a swing rider  and I help keep the cattle from straying. There are several other cowhands and  of course  a point rider and a cook. Lucky for us  we now have a talented cook who can turn anything into a delicious meal. Weve had much worse cooks in the past. One little piece of excitement that sticks out in my mind is the day a single gunshot started a cattle stampede. I didnt even have time to wonder where it came from  for in a split second  the longhorns had already taken off at an alarming run. It was all chaos for some time. Finally we managed to slow down the stampeding herd by turning them in a wide circle. That memory shall certainly amuse me for some years to come  and I do need some fun  for tomorrow I am returning to Texas for yet another cattle drive.

6,It was a hot summer day. My dad and I were getting ready to go out for a ride on the boat with my friend Katie and the dog. Thats when the phone call came  the call that made that bright  beautiful day a cold  dark  gloomy one. I had just put on my suit  shorts  and tank top  and packed my bag with sunscreen and everything else I would need for the day. I ran into my parents room to find Dad. When I saw him on the phone  he was crying. Id never seen my dad cry before. My heart sank. What possibly could have happened? Max  Im so sorry  I heard him say. Thats when it hit me. I knew that Suzie had died. Max has been my dads best friend for years. Suzie  his daughter  had a rare disease that mainly affected her body. Her brain was OK. She knew what was going on; she knew that she had problems and was different than other kids. Once she told her dad that she wished she could die and be born in a different body. Yet although she couldnt live a normal life  she was still happy. When Suzie and I were little  we spent quite a bit of time together. As we grew up  we grew apart. She lived in New York  and I lived in the Midwest. When Suzie was ten she had to live in a hospital in Virginia. About eight months before she died  Max gave us her number at the hospital and we talked at least twice a week until the end. Suzie was always so excited to talk to us and wanted to know every detail about my life. She wanted to know everything I did and everything I ate. In a way  she lived through me. After we found out about her death  we made our plans to go to New York for the funeral. When she was alive  I sent her a Beanie Baby and she sent one back to me. I had bought her another one but never had the chance to send it to her  so I took it to put in her casket. Her funeral was very different than any funeral Id ever been to. After they lowered her casket  each one of us put a shovelful of dirt over her. I remember crying so hard  I felt weak. My cheeks burned from the tears. My whole body was shaking as I picked up the shovel  but Im glad I did it. When Suzie and I first started calling one another  I thought it would be more of a burden on me  but I was completely wrong. I learned so much from her. She gave me more than I could ever give to her. I will never forget her or the talks we had. I now know that I must never take anything for granted  especially my health and the gift of life.,it be a hot summer day my dad and i be get ready to go out for a ride on the boat with my friend katie and the dog thats when the phone call come the call that make that bright beautiful day a cold dark gloomy one i have just put on my suit short and tank top and pack my bag with sunscreen and everything else i would need for the day i run into my parent room to find dad when i saw him on the phone he be cry id never see my dad cry before my heart sink what possibly could have happen max im so sorry i hear him say thats when it hit me i know that suzie have die max have be my dad best friend for year suzie his daughter have a rare disease that mainly affect her body her brain be ok she know what be go on she know that she have problem and be different than other kid once she tell her dad that she wish she could die and be bear in a different body yet although she couldnt live a normal life she be still happy when suzie and i be little we spend quite a bit of time together a we grow up we grow apart she live in new york and i live in the midwest when suzie be ten she have to live in a hospital in virginia about eight month before she die max give u her number at the hospital and we talk at least twice a week until the end suzie be always so excited to talk to u and want to know every detail about my life she want to know everything i do and everything i eat in a way she live through me after we find out about her death we make our plan to go to new york for the funeral when she be alive i send her a beanie baby and she send one back to me i have buy her another one but never have the chance to send it to her so i take it to put in her casket her funeral be very different than any funeral id ever be to after they lower her casket each one of u put a shovelful of dirt over her i remember cry so hard i felt weak my cheek burn from the tear my whole body be shake a i pick up the shovel but im glad i do it when suzie and i first start call one another i think it would be more of a burden on me but i be completely wrong i learn so much from her she give me more than i could ever give to her i will never forget her or the talk we have i now know that i must never take anything for grant especially my health and the gift of life,+ it was a hot summer day . + my dad and I were getting ready to go out for a ride on the boat with my friend + katie and the dog . + thats when the phone call came the call that made that bright beautiful day a cold dark gloomy one .

6,Memory. The dictionary defines it as the mental ability to recall past experiences. We think of it as that picture we saw  the words she said. Who in your life is so vivid in your memory that you could describe him or her without a second thought? For me  its my grandpa. But when I was small  I couldnt say Grandpa  so 13 years ago  Theodore Lazarus became Paw Paw. To all the grandkids  Paw Paw was full of fun and games. We all remember his favorite expressions  the ones that would pop out each time we saw him. Luckily  we visited Paw Paw quite often. We often overheard his little squabbles. No way  JosÃ©! Paw Paw would yell; in response  we would shout back  Yes way  JosÃ©! and burst into giggles. My younger siblings and cousins would tell Paw Paw about school  or ballet  or baseball  or their pet iguana  and just when they got into the story  hed roar  No kiddin! with a huge smile on his face. Paw Paw helped us remember that life should be fun. Being the oldest of all the grandchildren  I remember more than my siblings and cousins do  but we all remember how predictable Paw Paws clothes would be. Most likely  hed be wearing a white cotton shirt under another shirt  which was the kind that is red or blue  has one or two breast pockets  is plaid or striped  with buttons down the front. Being loose  it covered his big  round belly. Hed be sitting in the tall wooden chair in the corner by his desk  shouting into the black telephone with the big buttons. Or  if he wasnt there  hed be in his black leather recliner  watching a game on TV. Sometimes hed let us snuggle next to him. When Paw Paw wasnt relaxing  hed be in the backyard garden  weeding and pulling  planting and potting  until the time came in the spring or summer when the garden came alive with the colors of the flowers and vegetables he raised. I remember his old  worn hands that did everything: built the wooden tree house for me to play in  built the toolshed  plugged in the Barbie car so it would be ready for me to ride when I came over  fixed the DVD player so I could watch Wee Sing  and just played blocks with his grandchildren. He always took time to play with us. He would never tell us  but I know he was proud of all his nine grandkids. We ranged in age from 1-12 when he died last summer of a severe stroke. When I remember Paw Paw now  I think of the pictures on Grandmothers cabinetâ€”pictures of me and Paw Paw when I was two years old and the only grandchild.

6,It was a beautiful August morning. The sun was brightly shining on my sunglasses while my mother drove the U-haul truck to a warehouse in Santa Ana  California. As my mother drove down the streets of Santa Ana  I looked out the window and began to realize that the mixture of people was no longer a mixture; there was only white. When we arrived at the warehouse  I had to peel my arm off the side of the hot door like a burnt sausage off a skillet. There were not many cars in the parking lot  and I could see the heat waves. As we walked up the boiling pavement  it felt like we were walking through a scorching desert. When we walked into the warehouse  there was a variety of electronic appliances to choose from  and about three-fourths of them were white (of course). About every 15 minutes  a salesperson followed us around and asked if we needed help  as if we were retarded or ex-cons. My mother really dislikes it when salespersons constantly ask if we need help; she feels if she needs their help  shell ask for it. Finally  after about two and a half boring hours of looking for any scratches or marks on the dryers and refrigerators that might fit best in our new apartment  my mother picked a dryer and refrigerator that were just right. She then let the salesperson know  and he replied with a smile  All right  you can pick up your items in the back in about five minutes. My mother said  Thank you  in a nice  friendly voice and walked across the scorched pavement to drive the truck to the back. When we got to the back  there were about three open spaces for picking up appliances. My mother chose the first parking spot she saw  which was by a white familys car. Then she showed the employees the receipt for the appliances she had just bought. They said  All right  well be with you in just a minute. While I waited for my mother  I looked over and smiled at the white lady in the next car  but instead of smiling back like a nice young woman  she frowned at me like I had something hanging from my nose. At first I thought  Well  maybe she is having a bad day. Then a few minutes later the people working at the warehouse started to look at my mother and me in a mean way. Then I figured that maybe something was on my face  but when I looked in the mirror  I saw nothing. At the time  I had only spent nine years and some months on this planet. I didnt know racism was still around; I thought that situation had died along with Dr. King. Five minutes passed  then ten  then fifteen. We sat there watching people get their appliances and leave. We seemed invisible to them. As I sat in the car  burning up and listening to one of the most boring radio stations my mother could possibly like  I was thinking  Wed better leave or else Ill go ballistic! After 30 minutes had passed  my mother got frustrated and politely asked to have our items loaded. Five more minutes passed  and she asked again with an attitude. They replied  Well be with you in a minute  maam. I could tell she was beginning to get upset because she started to get that dont bother me look. Five minutes later they finally packed our appliances on the truck. When we left the warehouse  I described to my mother what the other people were doing. She explained  They were racist. They didnt like us because we have different skin color. That was my first encounter with racism. It was just a small slice of realityâ€”that everyone isnt going to be as nice as you  your friends  and your family might be; and that just because you look nice and politely smile at others  it doesnt mean that others will treat you the same. This situation made me feel very out of place and confused. I didnt expect those people to react as they did. We are all civilized  intelligent  caring  peaceful people . . . or at least that is what I had believed.,it be a beautiful august morning the sun be brightly shin on my sunglass while my mother drive the u haul truck to a warehouse in santa ana california a my mother drive down the street of santa ana i look out the window and begin to realize that the mixture of people be no long a mixture there be only white when we arrive at the warehouse i have to peel my arm off the side of the hot door like a burnt sausage off a skillet there be not many car in the parking lot and i could see the heat wave a we walk up the boiling pavement it felt like we be walk through a scorching desert when we walk into the warehouse there be a variety of electronic appliance to choose from and about three fourth of them be white of course about every minute a salesperson follow u around and ask if we need help a if we be retard or ex con my mother really dislike it when salesperson constantly ask if we need help she feel if she need their help shell ask for it finally after about two and a half boring hour of look for any scratch or mark on the dryer and refrigerator that might fit best in our new apartment my mother pick a dryer and refrigerator that be just right she then let the salesperson know and he reply with a smile all right you can pick up your item in the back in about five minute my mother say thank you in a nice friendly voice and walk across the scorched pavement to drive the truck to the back when we get to the back there be about three open space for pick up appliance my mother choose the first parking spot she saw which be by a white family car then she show the employee the receipt for the appliance she have just buy they say all right well be with you in just a minute while i wait for my mother i look over and smile at the white lady in the next car but instead of smile back like a nice young woman she frown at me like i have something hang from my nose at first i think well maybe she be have a bad day then a few minute later the people work at the warehouse start to look at my mother and me in a mean way then i figure that maybe something be on my face but when i look in the mirror i saw nothing at the time i have only spent nine year and some month on this planet i didnt know racism be still around i think that situation have die along with dr king five minute pass then ten then fifteen we sit there watch people get their appliance and leave we seem invisible to them a i sit in the car burn up and listen to one of the most boring radio station my mother could possibly like i be think wed well leave or else ill go ballistic after minute have pass my mother get frustrate and politely ask to have our item load five more minute pass and she ask again with an attitude they reply well be with you in a minute maam i could tell she be begin to get upset because she start to get that dont bother me look five minute later they finally pack our appliance on the truck when we leave the warehouse i describe to my mother what the other people be do she explain they be racist they didnt like u because we have different skin color that be my first encounter with racism it be just a small slice of reality that everyone isnt go to be as nice a you your friend and your family might be and that just because you look nice and politely smile at others it doesnt mean that others will treat you the same this situation make me feel very out of place and confuse i didnt expect those people to react a they do we be all civilized intelligent care peaceful people or at least that be what i have believe,+ it was a beautiful + august morning . + the sun was brightly shining on my sunglasses while my mother drove the U - haul truck to a warehouse in + santa + ana + california . + as my mother drove down the streets of + santa + ana I looked out the window and began to realize that the mixture of people was no longer a mixture ;

6,In the book The Best Little Girl in the World  Kessa has a serious eating disorder called anorexia nervosa. But she is not alone. Many people have this eating disorder  and this book shows its harmful effects. This is an emotional and invigorating story of a determined girl and her fight to survive. In the beginning of her story  Kessa is a normal 15-year-old. She has many talents  especially dancing. She has danced for many years and loves it. One day her dance teacher tells her to continue eating right  but maybe lose a few pounds. Once Kessa hears this  she takes things too far. Instead of cutting down on snacks and junk food  she decides to not eat at all. She does not eat breakfast  lunch  or dinner. Her new eating habits continue  and she begins losing weight. One after another  she loses the pounds  and her body becomes slimmer and slimmer. She loses weight to a point where she is extremely unhealthy. As her poor eating habits continue  her parents start interfering. They want to get as much help as possible to cure their beautiful daughter. But it is just as hard for Kessas parents to deal with her disorder as it is for her. They are baffled by their daughters strict diet. She lives day in and day out  exercising to lose more pounds and planning what and when she will eat. Her parents try everything  but Kessas dieting continues. She is determined to have no fat on her body. Her obsession continues. Kessas doctor and parents finally decide to admit her to the hospital. She is now so skinny that she can barely walk. There  she goes through a nightmare. Despite good care  all Kessa can think about is how much weight she might gain. Throughout the rest of the book  Kessa goes through many troubles in order to cure her eating disorder. Many other people have this same disorder. This book  I think  can help to prevent people from doing this to themselves. It shows the trouble that people go through just to be slender  and all the scary things they must experience to be cured. It is an emotionally powerful book about a girls fight to survive  and I think every teenager should read it.,in the book the best little girl in the world kessa have a serious eating disorder call anorexia nervosa but she be not alone many people have this eating disorder and this book show it harmful effect this be an emotional and invigorate story of a determined girl and her fight to survive in the beginning of her story kessa be a normal year old she have many talent especially dance she have dance for many year and love it one day her dance teacher tell her to continue eat right but maybe lose a few pound once kessa hears this she take thing too far instead of cut down on snack and junk food she decide to not eat at all she do not eat breakfast lunch or dinner her new eating habit continue and she begin lose weight one after another she lose the pound and her body become slim and slim she lose weight to a point where she be extremely unhealthy a her poor eating habit continue her parent start interfere they want to get as much help a possible to cure their beautiful daughter but it be just as hard for kessas parent to deal with her disorder a it be for her they be baffle by their daughter strict diet she live day in and day out exercise to lose more pound and plan what and when she will eat her parent try everything but kessas dieting continue she be determine to have no fat on her body her obsession continue kessas doctor and parent finally decide to admit her to the hospital she be now so skinny that she can barely walk there she go through a nightmare despite good care all kessa can think about be how much weight she might gain throughout the rest of the book kessa go through many trouble in order to cure her eat disorder many other people have this same disorder this book i think can help to prevent people from do this to themselves it show the trouble that people go through just to be slender and all the scary thing they must experience to be cure it be an emotionally powerful book about a girl fight to survive and i think every teenager should read it,+ in the book + the + best + little + girl in the + world + kessa has a serious eating disorder called anorexia nervosa . + but she is not alone . + many people have this eating disorder and this book shows its harmful effects . + this is an emotional and invigorating story of a determined girl and her fight to survive . + in the beginning of her story + kessa is a normal 15 - year - old . + she has many talents especially dancing . + she has danced for many years and loves it . + one day her dance teacher tells her to continue eating right but maybe lose a few pounds . + once + kessa hears this she takes things too far . + instead of cutting down on snacks and junk food she decides to not eat at all . + she does not eat breakfast lunch or dinner . + her new eating habits continue and she begins losing weight . + one after another she loses the pounds and her body becomes slimmer and slimmer . + she loses weight to a point where she is extremely unhealthy . + as her poor eating habits continue her parents start interfering . + they want to get as much help as possible to cure their beautiful daughter . + but it is just as hard for + kessas parents to deal with her disorder as it is for her . + they are baffled by their daughters strict diet . + she lives day in and day out exercising to lose more pounds and planning what and when she will eat . + her parents try everything but + kessas dieting continues . + she is determined to have no fat on her body . + her obsession continues . + kessas doctor and parents finally decide to admit her to the hospital . + she is now so skinny that she can barely walk . + there she goes through a nightmare . + despite good care all + kessa can think about is how much weight she might gain . + throughout the rest of the book + kessa goes through many troubles in order to cure her eating disorder . + many other people have this same disorder . + this book I think can help to prevent people from doing this to themselves . + it shows the trouble that people go through just to be slender and all the scary things they must experience to be cured . + it is an emotionally powerful book about a girls fight to survive and I think every teenager should read it . 
6,Long ago and once upon a time  there lived a princess. Her name was Oriana  and her entire court loved her. She always helped those in need and had a smile for everyone. Oriana wasnt vain  although she had every reason to be. She had wavy  raven hair that fell past her knees; pure  olive skin; and a face that was perfectly oval. Her real beauty  however  lay in her eyes. Whenever Oriana felt an emotion strongly  they changed from their usual ebony to true gold. It seemed that nothing could make her angry; but alas  it was not so. Her aunt ruled the kingdom while Orianas father was away tending to his peoples needs. Aunt Desdemona was selfish  petty  and cruel. She was proud of her immortal beauty and didnt hesitate to show it. The people hated and feared her. Jealous of the way the court adored her niece but detested her  Desdemona devised a plan. If she were to send Oriana on a quest to find the lost crown . . . yes  that would work. The crown was the key to the realms power. It had been taken away by an immortal centuries ago  and the kingdom had been having difficulties ever since. Only someone of royal blood could touch the crown  so that fact gave Desdemona a legitimate reason for sending Oriana to reclaim it. Orianas father wouldnt be able to argue with such a decision. Smiling a smile that didnt reach her ice-blue eyes  Desdemona called her niece to her chambers. She proceeded to explain that the king needed the crown if they were to save the kingdom from ruin. And dont come back until youve got the crown. Oriana sighed and nodded. No matter what her aunt thought  she wasnt stupid. She knew that Desdemona just wanted to get rid of her. Where on earth was she supposed to find the crown? They had been looking for centuries and no one had ever found it! And at night  alone  she was liable to get killed. There was nothing in nights sky to light her way  and Oriana couldnt possibly carry enough oil for a lantern. The sky is so frightful at night. During the day it is pretty  with the sun  but at night it is solid black . . . Lost in her thoughts  Oriana didnt realize that she had already exited the castle grounds. Then a thought popped into her mind so suddenly that she gasped. Maybe no one has found the crown on earth  because it isnt on earth anymore! But where could it be? Then her mind snapped everything into place  like pieces of a puzzle. If the immortal that stole the crown had wings  maybe it had hidden the crown in the sky. Oriana groaned. This just presented another problem: How was she supposed to search the sky? Abruptly  an immortals voice echoed in her head. Well done  Mortal. You are the first of your kind to get this far. The rest will not be easy. In a few moments it will be dark. I will place you in the sky. You have tonight  and tonight only  to solve my riddle and locate the crown. If you lose  you must stay in the sky forever. Are we agreed? About to say  Yes  Oriana was stopped by a chuckle. I can hear your thoughts  Mortal. Be prepared to lose! The sun started to dip below the horizon. The rest of the sky was already dark  and the last red glow reminded Oriana of blood. Red turned to black  and then the world was below her. It was time to begin the search. The immortal spoke again  Here is my riddle: Near yet far  Conquer the dark  Is it needed by the czar? Make your mark. End of the day  As the light fades away  Remember thisâ€” Nothing gold can forever stay. Oriana almost started to walk before she realized that she would be lost in pitch blackness. Thinking desperately of how to light her path  she looked down. Her necklace  made of shiny beads  was glowing brightly. Breaking the clasp  she started to move. Every few seconds she dropped a bead. She wandered all over the sky  trying to solve the riddle. It didnt make any sense. Oriana went left  right  east  west  diagonally  all directions everywhereâ€”occasionally  she dropped one of the sapphires or rubies from her necklace as well. Finally  Oriana reached the round silver stone in the middle of her necklace. She had only half of her light source left and wasnt any closer to finding the crown. Tossing the silver ball into the inky darkness  she continued. Just as dawn was about to grace the sky  Oriana realized two things. The beads crisscrossed in every direction; some had been kicked into funny-looking clusters. And the crown? It was still lost. She remembered the last line of the riddle: Nothing gold can forever stay. The crown was made of gold! Did it mean that they didnt need the crown? Well  have you found the crown yet  Mortal? the immortals voice slammed through her head. Taking a deep breath before remembering that she didnt have to speak  Oriana silently explained her theory about the riddles last line. You are correct  unfortunately. The crown is only a symbol of power and of greed. The immortal sighed  I cannot give you the crown. It was destroyed long ago. However  I can give you this. He handed her a golden flame. It didnt burn or radiate heat; it just glowed. The flame tickled and was too bright to stare at for very long. It is the Flame of Guilt. Give it to someone who has unjustly wronged you  and watch the flame. Use it quickly  for like everything else gold  it will not last long. The voice had been getting softer and softer. Orianas last conscious thought before falling asleep was  Im home in my bed. Desdemona was furious when a maid came running to her room  shrieking that the princess was home. It didnt help that her plan to be the center of attention had failed. She had thought that with Oriana out of the way  the entire court would love her. On the contrary  the people hated her even more because there was no one to cheer them as Oriana had. Stalking angrily to her throne  Desdemona waited for her niece to bring her the crown. At least with the crown she would be extremely powerful and could perhaps get rid of the little brat once and for all. She continued to think in this vein for some time and didnt realize that Oriana was in the room until a courtier announced her. Oriana stood quietly for a moment  studying her aunt. Then she opened her left hand. The golden flame twined round her fingers and blazed in her palm  lighting the entire gathering. The court watched breathlessly as she began to speak. I did not find the crown. It was destroyed long ago. The immortal who stole it  however  gave me this as a reward for using his clues to solve the mystery. She gestured at the flame. I would like to give it to my aunt as a gift  for being so kind as to trust me with this quest. Orianas musical voice paused  and she added  Please  Aunt  accept my gift. Desdemona was suspicious  but her greedy nature took command. Yes  my dear  her face showing disgust as she said it  I will accept your flame. There is a condition  my aunt. Only one who is pure of heart may hold the Flame of Guilt. If someone unworthy touches it  she will spend the rest of her life as a servant in the Faerie Court. Oriana searched her aunts face. Desdemona was horrified. If she refused to take it  the court would think she had done something evil. If she took it  the entire court would know she had done evil. She said  Of course  you know you are putting me into a rather awkward position  dear Oriana. I shall need to consult with my personal psychic prior to accepting your gift; but rest assured  she continued  an evil gleam in her eye  justice will prevail. Desdemona summoned the court psychic and huddled with him as everyone looked on with great anticipation. A terrible frown overcame her face  and she screamed  Get out! You know nothing! Then she approached Oriana  and  resigning herself to a life waiting on picky  irritating little faeries  she took the flame. Desdemona began to fade and  with one last look of disgust at Oriana  disappeared  never to be seen again. That night  a blissfully happy princess looked out her window  expecting to see the usual suffocating blackness. Instead  she saw that the silver stone at the center of her necklace and all of the other beads and gems were gleaming in the sky. It was beautiful. That is the tale of how Oriana conquered the night  How the stars came to shine so bright. How she planted the moon and stars as beads  And revealed Desdemonas evil deeds.,long ago and once upon a time there live a princess her name be oriana and her entire court love her she always help

6,It was a normal Saturday on Oak Streetâ€”the same morning dew sparkling on the grass  the same cherry blossoms swaying in the breeze  the same daffodils bursting with color. Yes  as far as anyone could tell  it was a normal day in Washington  D.C. When Katie awoke  she got dressed  brushed her teeth and hair  and checked her to do list. Then she hurried down for breakfast: rich  fluffy  chocolate-chip pancakes; fresh orange juice; crispy bacon; and crunchy  buttered toast. Katies stomach growled loudly. Smells good  Mom  Katie said. Good morning! her mother chimed happily. Eat up. You sound like youre starving to death! Katie sat down and ate. So whats on the agenda today  Katie? Today I have the Library Club with June and Cat  Katie said. As soon as she finished eating  she scraped her plate (even though there was barely a crumb on it) and went outside. Katie loved everything to do with nature. She wanted to be an environmentalist when she grew up. She sat in her favorite spot under the massive cherry tree  where she had a spectacular view of the Washington Monument. Before heading to the library  she thought of what to do with her week of spring break. As Katie sat down on the rug of Lindens Library with her best friends June and Cat (short for Catherine)  she noticed a new book on the table. Its title was Wild Safari. When the librarian said they could pick their books  Katie ran to the table and snatched the book before anyone else could. Then she walked over to the checkout counter  where Linden stood. Linden was a tall  lanky man with blazing blue eyes that were strangely magnified by his green glasses. He had brown hair styled in a stubbly crew cut. He was about 35 years old  Katie thought. Most of the time he was cheery  and he always told the truth. Hello  Katie  he said. Hi  Linden  said Katie. I was wondering if I could check out this new book. She showed him Wild Safari. I wouldnt take that book  Katie  Linden said. Why? asked Katie. Because if you take that book  bad things will happen  Linden said. Katie gave him a puzzled look. What kind of things? she asked. I dont know  but theyll be bad  Linden warned. Well  will you still allow me to check out the book? Katie asked. Yes  but only because I think I know how to stop the bad stuff if it does happen  Linden replied. So Katie checked out the book and went to find June and Cat. She saw that June was holding The Long Winter and Cat had The Secret Garden. Katie shared with them every word of her conversation with Linden. Thats odd  said June. Normally he tells the truth  but I think hes trying to scare you. After all  its only a book  right? But somehow her words didnt convince Katie. Katies thoughts were unsettled  so she went to her favorite spot  where she could always make sense of things. She sat down under the tree and started to read the book. It was full of jungle animal adventuresâ€”everything from anteaters to zebras. After reading three chapters  she brought the book inside and put it on her nightstand. That evening  after eating a scrumptious dinner  Katie went to her room to change into her pjs. She went to the living room to watch TV with her family  and then she retreated to her room so she could read more. When she got to the ninth chapter  she fell asleep. Thats when the madness began. When Katie woke up  her world was upside-down. Everything in sight was covered in ivy  and it seemed to be growing out of her book! She grabbed desperately for some scissors and went outside. The landscape couldnt have been more different. All of Washington was covered with ivyâ€”even the Washington Monument! She ran back inside and jumped on her mom to wake her up. When her mom opened her eyes  she screamed  which woke up her dad  who also screamed. They seemed to be frozen with fear! Katie decided that they were no help  so she ran to her friend Junes house. They were just waking up and didnt see the ivy because it wasnt inside their house. They were all shocked to see Katie there and wondered why she looked so flustered. Look outside  she said in little more than a whisper. They all went outside  and their reaction was the same as Katies parents. June was the only one who didnt freeze with fear. June  Katie said  do you have any clue how this happened? No  June said  trembling  but lets think over the conversation you had with Linden. Good thinking  said Katie. They went to Junes room and talked for an hour. Finally  Katie remembered that Linden had said that he knew how to stop the bad stuff if it happened. Lets pay him a visit  said June. They both ran to Lindens house. They could tell everything was getting worseâ€”animals were everywhere  and the ivy was getting thicker. They had to cut the ivy with Katies scissors just to ring the doorbell at Lindens house! When he answered the door  Katie asked  Can we stop it? Linden said just one word before he fainted. The word was shred. He must mean shred the book! Katie said. She and June ran as fast as they could to Katies house and tried to find their way through the thick ivy to the book. When they eventually got to the book  Katie and June beat and shredded the book until it let out a strange shriek  sucked in all the ivy and animals that had escaped its pages  and vanished. No one except Katie and June knew what really happened that eerie day. To this day  they still look for the mysterious book. Who knows where it will appear next . . . ? ,it be a normal saturday on oak street the same morning dew sparkle on the grass the same cherry blossom sway in the breeze the same daffodil burst with color yes as far a anyone could tell it be a normal day in washington d c when katie awake she get dressed brush her teeth and hair and check her to do list then she hurry down for breakfast rich

6,My backyard breathes life! The plants gather the sunlight with bending and reaching arms. Trailing vines hold onto the fences with curling fingers.

6,In the beginning  my people were primitive  and they used my resources to survive. They used stone  and then bronze and iron for tools. They traded with other peoples from afar  beyond my reaches. They became clever and prosperous; they built permanent homes for themselves. I was happy. I am beautiful. I stretch from the Baltic Sea to the southern Daugava River  and the lands within are rich. Or  at least  they once were . . . before the invaders came. But my lands had contained riches  of dolomite and lumber  and most of all  of amber. Amber  the ancient tree sap that had turned to rock over time  had become more precious than gold. My people traded amber gathered along my coasts to places around the vast world  and became very rich. They farmed the land and grew grain and flax. Their meals were simple but wholesome. Some special foods were kisels  eaten only on holidays  and putras  a porridge of barley and oats. Their lives were simple. Then the first invaders came. They called themselves the Teutonic Knights  or Knights of the Sword. They attacked my people  destroying whole towns! Our warriors tried to fight but were slaughtered by the advanced weapons of our conquerors. Soon  they had taken away my lands  and they began to convert my people to a new religion called Catholicism. One of the knights founded Riga  my capital city  and the jewel of my land. Unfortunately  my people were horribly oppressed under the harsh Teutonic rule. And so it continued. The Teutonics were overthrown by the Polish  the Polish were overthrown by the Lithuanians  the Lithuanians were overthrown by the Russians. My people were always second-class citizens  never independent  never given their own identity. And yet  in some places  the old ways remained  and my people held on. The St. Petersburg Paper was published in Riga from 1862-1865. It created some of the earliest feelings of nationalism among my people. Its main editors were Krisjanis Barons and Krisjanis Valdemars. Written only a little later  in 1873  was the Latvian National Anthem (considered so 50 years before Latvia would become a country)  Dievs Svcti Latviyu  or God Bless Latvia. Time passed. The Germans captured my country next and made my people into slaves. Then  once again  it was the Russians! I wondered if it would ever end. But I had been in existence for a long time  and I was patient. Finally  after nearly 900 years since my people had been independent at all  a Great War broke out throughout the land. The Russians  who were the rulers  had a revolution  and lost their hold on my people in 1918. We became independent! I was so proud of them. A president was elected  and my people recovered  multiplied  and prospered once more. Later  the government of my people became corrupt. A man named Karlis Ulmanis declared a state of emergency and took it over. He was a dictator  but a benevolent one  and he saved the government from collapse. My country began to become one of the richest in the land. But disaster struck again. Another Great War began  and we were attacked by the Russians. Our armies  despite being untrained  fought better than they did  but still they outnumbered us. They pushed my people back until the only ones still fighting were trapped in a castle in the center of Riga. Then they  too  fell. The Russians had a new form of government called Communism. They took away all the farms and made them into huge  collectivized impersonal farms  where my people slaved away to live. Then the Germans and the Russians fought  with both sides burning my fields and killing my people. We were caught in the middle  and we couldnt get out. In the end  the Russians won control over us. They polluted my air  land  and water with foul toxins in the name of industrialization. And so we were ruled  for nearly another 50 years. My people wanted independence  for  beyond the bad treatment of their land  the Russians had no similar culture. Not even their language or alphabet was the same! My people use a Roman alphabet  and the Russians use Cyrillic. My people speak Lettish  a language totally different than Russian. Then things finally began to change. The Russian government began to weaken. My people  allied with people of the neighboring lands of Estonia and Lithuania  spoke out against the Russians. Protesters formed a human chain across the three countries. The Freedom Movement in Riga  a giant statue of a person holding three five-pointed stars  was sculpted by Elmars Rudzitis at this time. When the Russian government collapsed  we were officially granted independence! The new government was a democracy. The president and Prime Minister were elected  and so was the 100-seat Saeima  or parliament. Many political parties sprang up. There was much to recover from  but my people still had their culture and their heritage. Without the supplies that the Russians had made my people dependent on  there was less money and fewer jobs. And cleaning up the pollution was a huge job. But my people struggled through it. Slowly the economy began to improve  and my people began to manufacture goods to be sent to other lands. Some of the old way of life resumed when the farms were de-collectivized  and freedom grew. Many aspects of my peoples culture live on. The dainas  which were sacred four-line poems/songs  are still known today. My people are very fond of singing. Since 1876  they have held the Latvian Song Festival  where thousands of people go to sing and dance. It has gone on every five years since then. Folk dances are very popular  too. Many of my people still wear the national costume  which is a traditional suit for men  and a brightly woven skirt over a white blouse for women. Women also sometimes wear glittery golden headbands. Traditional instruments that are played are the stringed kokle  the reed stabule  and the percussion trejdeksnis. Much song and dance goes on during the holidays. During Ziemas Zvetki  or Winter Holiday  everyone sings of the sun soon to be returning to warm my lands. Though I exist far to the north  the Atlantic Current flows into the Baltic Sea and keeps me warm. Jani  or St. Johns Day  is a holiday where people sing and chant all night to ward off evil spirits. Men and women wear wreaths of wildflowers  and this holiday brings together the ancient Earth-worshipping beliefs and the newer Christian ones. During the Russian occupation  my people were often not allowed to practice any religions  and nearly all my people who were Jewish were killed when the Germans came through. Now  though  many religions are flourishing  and religious tolerance is practiced. The Coat of Arms is a symbol of myself and my people. On it are a red lion that symbolizes the southern half of my lands  and a white griffin that symbolizes the northern half. A ribbon ties the two halves together. In the last millenium  my people had only been independent for 40 total years. But this time  they were going to hold on to their freedom and national pride. And so  I sit back and watch them. I am proud of my people  they have accomplished much in the face of terrible odds. They are a beautiful people in a beautiful land. I have seen them. And I remember.,in the beginning my people be primitive and they use my resource to survive they use stone and then bronze and iron for tool they trade with other people from afar beyond my reach they become clever and prosperous they build permanent home for themselves i be happy i be beautiful i stretch from the baltic sea to the southern daugava river and the land within be rich or at least they once be before the invader come but my land have contain rich of dolomite and lumber and most of all of amber amber the ancient tree sap that have turn to rock over time have become more precious than

6,Before the International Space Station  the largest structure in space was the Mir space station. The Soviets (and Russians) built Mir in orbit from 1986 to 1996. The station lasted another five years before its orbit decayed and it burned up on re-entry in 2001. As the first modular space station  Mir pushed the frontiers of science  but as a result  living conditions inside werent glamorous. Mir astronauts were more like the early pioneers who risked their lives but kept going and made their mission a success. Mirs struggles began with the space station itself. By 1998  Mir had already made its 69 560th orbit of the earth. Thats 1.83 billion miles! In addition to having high mileage  Mir had a computer system that was ancient. Since Mir blasted off in 1986  astronauts had to fix more than 1 500 problems on the ship. Most were small  but a few were big. In February 1997  a fire shut down an oxygen generator. Then in June 1997  a spaceship carrying supplies to Mir crashed into a solar panel (Chien 97). Many times  the crew sat in the dark because there wasnt enough power to work the computers or do experiments. Like the pioneers who headed west in covered wagons  Mir astronauts learned to do the best they could with what they had. For example  Mir astronauts wore their cotton T-shirts  gym shorts  and socks for two weeks! The astronauts wore the clothes day and night and even exercised in them. After two weeks  astronauts just pitched the stinky stuff into space where it burned up in the earths atmosphere (Hoversten). Life on Mir could be downright unhealthy. The humid air made mold grow  and the mold spoiled the food. The crew couldnt wash well  and infections spread quickly  especially when new astronauts came on board. After their bodies were weightless for a long time  the bones in their lower hips and spines got weaker (Chien 99). Then  when astronauts went back to Earth  they had more problems. They had poor balance  weak muscles  and severe soreness (Covault 76). The living conditions on Mir wouldve made even Captain Kirk return to Earth. Fans hummed nonstop. The smell of gasoline hung in the air  and food was served up freeze-dried. The shower often was broken  so the crew had to take sponge baths. Even sleeping was hard. Jerry Linenger spent 132 days on Mir with these problems. He said  Theres something about it [life on Mir] that makes you feel  â€˜Yeah  Im on the frontier  (Hoversten). Even though life on Mir wasnt glamorous and equipment often failed  the Mir astronauts had lots of success. Like the pioneers  the astronauts found many useful things that helped explorers who followed them. But maybe Mirs greatest success was that astronauts from Russia and the U.S.  two old enemies  worked together as friends (Chien 99).,before the international space station the large structure in space be the mir space station the soviet and russian build mir in orbit from to the station last another five year before it orbit decayed and it burn up on re entry in a the first modular space station mir push the frontier of science but a a result living condition inside werent glamorous mir astronaut be more like the early pioneer who risk their life but keep go and make their mission a success mirs struggle begin with the space station itself by mir have already make it th orbit of the earth thats billion mile in addition to have high mileage mir have a computer system that be ancient since mir blast off in astronaut have to fix more than problem on the ship most be small but a few be big in february a fire shut down an oxygen generator then in june a spaceship carry supply to mir crash into a solar panel chien many time the crew sit in the dark because there wasnt enough power to work the computer or do experiment like the pioneer who head west in covered wagon mir astronaut learn to do the best they could with what they have for example mir astronaut wear their cotton t shirt gym short and sock for two week the astronaut wear the clothes day and night and even exercise in them after two week astronauts just pitch the stinky stuff into space where it burn up in the earth atmosphere hoversten life on mir could be downright unhealthy the humid air make mold grow and the mold spoil the food the crew couldnt wash well and infection spread quickly especially when new astronaut come on board after their body be weightless for a long time the bone in their low hip and spine get weak chien then when astronaut go back to earth they have more problem they have poor balance weak muscle and severe soreness covault the living condition on mir wouldve make even captain kirk return to earth fan hum nonstop the smell of gasoline hung in the air and food be serve up freeze dry the shower often be break so the crew have to take sponge bath even sleep be hard jerry linenger spent day on mir with these problem he say there something about it life on mir that make you feel yeah im on the frontier hoversten even though life on mir wasnt glamorous and equipment often fail the mir astronaut have lot of success like the pioneer the astronaut find many useful thing that help explorer who follow them but maybe mirs great success be that astronaut from russia and the u s two old enemy work together a friend chien,+ before the + international + space + station the largest structure in space was the + mir space station . + the + soviets ( and + russians ) built + mir in orbit from 1986 to 1996 . + the station lasted another five years before its orbit decayed and it burned up on re - entry in 2001 . + as the first modular space station + mir pushed the frontiers of science but as a result living conditions inside werent glamorous . + mir astronauts were more like the early pioneers who risked their lives but kept going and made their mission a success . + mirs struggles began with the space station itself . + by 1998 + mir had already made its 69 560th orbit of the earth . + thats *url billion miles !

6,More than any other state  Hawaii is world famous for its beauty and pleasant climate. This is probably why Hawaii  the Aloha State  is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the world  and why I would love to visit this state someday. Besides being a great place for tourists  though  Hawaii is also a great place to live and has over one million residents. Hawaii is made up entirely of islands and is located in the mid-Pacific Ocean. The closest of its islands to the U.S. mainland is about 2 091 miles southwest of San Francisco. Hawaii is the youngest of the 50 states; it joined the union in 1959. The state of Hawaii has a mixed population of Japanese  Filipino  Polynesian  and Chinese. The people are proud that their state is a community with many different backgrounds. Many people are mixtures of several nationalities and races. More than four-fifths of its people live in urban areas  mostly in Honolulu on the island of Oahu. The climate in Hawaii is mild throughout the year with little difference between the hottest and coldest month. Honolulu  for example  has a normal daily temperature of 72 degrees in January and 80 degrees in July. Precipitation is uneven throughout the year because of the surrounding water. Usual precipitation for the year is about 480 inches of rainfall. However  Honolulu receives only 23 inches annually  most of it falling between November and March. Tourism is the leading money maker in this beautiful state  with service industries accounting for 87 percent of Hawaiis gross state product (the total value of goods and services produced in a state in a year). Each year  the islands attract over three million visitors. Oahu is the leading destination for most tourists. The states warm climate and its fine sand beaches are the leading attractions  as are the many top golf courses. There are also other attractions to visit in Hawaii  like Haleakala National Park on Maui and Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the island of Hawaii. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park contains two active volcanoes at the present time. In this park is Mauna Loa  the worlds largest volcano. This park is about 229 000 acres in area. It was created in 1961 and extends eastward from the summit of Mauna Loa to the Pacific Ocean  passing a 30-mile section of the coast. Mauna Loa is 13 677 feet above sea level. Its submerged portion rises 20 000 feet above the seafloor. Kilauea  the parks other active volcano  rises from the eastern flank of Mauna Loa to an elevation of just over 4 000 feet. Haleakala National Park boasts Haleakala Crater  the worlds largest inactive volcanic crater. It measures about 20 miles around and is about 3 000 feet deep. Another great thing to do in Hawaii besides sightseeing would be fishing. The fishing industry is very small in the state  although it is expanding. Some major types of fish caught there are yellowfin and skipjack tuna. It would be easy to communicate while visiting Hawaii because almost all of the people speak English. But they frequently use some of the more musical words of the Hawaiian language in their speech. For example  they call tourists malihini  meaning newcomer. Another familiar Hawaiian word is aloha  which means love  greetings  welcome  and farewell. They also communicate through their hula  which means dance. These dances tell stories about the islands. Hawaiian music uses steel guitars and the ukelele  which means leaping flea. One of Hawaiis only problems is transportation. Most goods have to be shipped by air or sea  so things are very expensive. Airlines are the quickest and easiest way to travel in Hawaii. But travel within the state is expensive because the islands are widely separated. The biggest airport is the Honolulu International. Another problem is keeping the islands beautiful with all of the increased tourist business. Tourists spend over $4 billion in Hawaii each year  but the people who live there dont want all of these people destroying the natural beauty of their homeland. Despite the problems of transportation and increased tourism  Hawaii is still a great place to visit or live because of the warm climate and the beauty of the islands.

6,On October 5  I gathered a large Styrofoam cup  an egg  some vinegar  some corn syrup  and some water. Before I started the lab  I weighed the egg on a scale. Because the egg would just roll off the scale if I set it down by itself  I weighed the cup  and then added the egg. After I knew how much the egg weighed  I poured enough vinegar in the cup to submerge the egg. I then covered the top of the cup with plastic wrap and set the egg aside. The next day  I washed the egg and the cup and weighed the egg. Then I poured in enough corn syrup to cover the egg  and I once again covered the cup with plastic wrap and set it aside. The third and final day of this lab  I cleaned the egg and the cup and weighed the egg again. For the last part of the experiment  I covered the egg with water  put plastic wrap over the cup  and set it aside  following up the next day with another weigh-in. Observations: After letting the egg sit in vinegar for 24 hours  the hard part of the shell had been eaten off. The part of the soft shell that was left was very smooth and slimy. The egg weighed a little less than the day before because the heaviest part of the shell was gone. The egg also had a small dent in it because the outside was so fragile. When I tried to wash off the extra vinegar  I almost dropped the egg because it was so slippery. On the second day  when I washed off the corn syrup  the egg was very light. It had numerous dents in it  and it was so fragile that I could barely wash it off. The egg was very slippery and extremely slimy  but I managed to hold on. It felt like I was holding a blown-up balloon in my handâ€”thats how light the egg was. On the third day  when I took the egg out of the water  I found that it was a little bit heavier than the day before. There were not as many dents in the egg  so it was much easier to wash off. The egg was still a little bit slippery and kind of slimy  but overall  it was in much better shape than the day before. Conclusions: I discovered that the shell peeled off in the vinegar because of an acidic reaction. The acid in the vinegar peeled away the shell. When the egg was soft and light from the corn syrup  it was because water had left the egg to cause a state of equilibrium. The water had made the egg heavy and somewhat sturdy. When the egg was in the water  the water diffused into the egg to cause a state of equilibrium  and that is why the egg was heavier on that day. I really had a fun time experimenting with my egg. I learned a lot about diffusion and equilibrium.,on october i gather a large styrofoam cup an egg some vinegar some corn syrup and some water before i start the lab i weigh the egg on a scale because the egg would just roll off the scale if i set it down by itself i weigh the cup and then add the egg after i know how much the egg weigh i pour enough vinegar in the cup to submerge the egg i then cover the top of the cup with plastic wrap and set the egg aside the next day i wash the egg and the cup and weigh the egg then i pour in enough corn syrup to cover the egg and i once again cover the cup with plastic wrap and set it aside the third and final day of this lab i clean the egg and the cup and weigh the egg again for the last part of the experiment i cover the egg with water put plastic wrap over the cup and set it aside follow up the next day with another weigh in observation after let the egg sit in vinegar for hour the hard part of the shell have be eat off the part of the soft shell that be leave be very smooth and slimy the egg weigh a little less than the day before because the heavy part of the shell be go the egg also have a small dent in it because the outside be so fragile when i try to wash off the extra vinegar i almost drop the egg because it be so slippery on the second day when i wash off the corn syrup the egg be very light it have numerous dent in it and it be so fragile that i could barely wash it off the egg be very slippery and extremely slimy but i manage to hold on it felt like i be hold a blow up balloon in my hand thats how light the egg be on the third day when i take the egg out of the water i find that it be a little bit heavy than the day before there be not a many dent in the egg so it be much easy to wash off the egg be still a little bit slippery and kind of slimy but overall it be in much good shape than the day before conclusion i discover that the shell peel off in the vinegar because of an acidic reaction the acid in the vinegar peel away the shell when the egg be soft and light from the corn syrup it be because water have leave the egg to cause a state of equilibrium the water have make the egg heavy and somewhat sturdy when the egg be in the water the water diffuse into the egg to cause a state of equilibrium and that be why the egg be heavy on that day i really have a fun time experiment with my egg i learn a lot about diffusion and equilibrium,+ on + october 5 I gathered a large + styrofoam cup an egg some vinegar some corn syrup and some water . + before I started the lab I weighed the egg on a scale . + because the egg would just roll off the scale if I set it down by itself I weighed the cup and then added the egg . + after I knew how much the egg weighed I poured enough vinegar in the cup to submerge the egg .

6,If you visit northern Wisconsin  dont be surprised to hear the eerie and beautiful howl of wolves at night. They have returned after about 40 years of absence. By the 1950s  wolves had been driven out of their ancient homeland by ranchers and the federal government. Wolves killed livestock for food  so they were considered nuisances. But starting in the 1990s  the state reintroduced wolves to help manage the deer population. The number of wolves has now rebounded to nearly a thousand. Wolves are relatives to coyotes  foxes  jackals  dingoes  and our pet dogs. Some people mistake wolves and coyotes  but wolves are much larger and stockier. A wolf is like a German shepherd except with longer legs  bigger feet  a wider head  and a long  bushy tail. Like a dog  a wolf has very good vision  smell  and hearing  which allow it to track and kill caribou  deer  elk  and moose. Wolves sometimes eat 20 pounds of meat at one time with their 42 teeth. Wolves hunt mainly at night and early in the morning. At birth  a wolf pup weighs one pound. At three weeks  pups start to eat meat. Each spring  wolves have six to fourteen pups  which are born in dens. A den can be a cave  the hollow trunk of a tree  a hole that the mother dug  or a thicket. Wolf packs have eight to twenty members. The leader  called the alpha male  always gets food first  and if anyone butts in  they get growled and snarled at. Wolves communicate by howling  tail actions  and mouth actions. When wolves cant find food  they eat leftovers from other kills that they have buried  but they can go several weeks without food. Packs need 100 to 250 square miles to live in. Wolves can run up to 24 miles per hour. Most animals they hunt can run faster  but wolves can run tirelessly for hours and can leap as high as one-story buildings. Wolves used to live all over North America  Europe  and Asia  but after the 1950s wolf populations survived only in northern Minnesota and Alaska in the United States  in Canada  northern Europe  and northern Asia. Now they are making a comeback in other areas because scientists recognize their important role as apex predators. Wolves can live in any type of climate except for the desert and the highest mountains. Their color varies from pure white to jet black  depending on where they live. Wolves are fun to watch and listen to. Now that wolves are starting to move back into some of the lower 48 states  you might hear them howl again.,if you visit northern wisconsin dont be surprise to hear the eerie and beautiful howl of wolf at night they have return after about year of absence by the s wolf have be drive out of their ancient homeland by rancher and the federal government wolf kill livestock for food so they be consider nuisance but start in the s the state reintroduce wolf to help manage the deer population the number of wolf have now rebound to nearly a thousand wolf be relatives to coyotes foxes jackal dingo and our pet dog some people mistake wolf and coyote but wolf be much large and stocky a wolf be like a german shepherd except with long leg big foot a wider head and a long bushy tail like a dog a wolf have very good vision smell and hearing which allow it to track and kill caribou deer elk and moose wolf sometimes eat pound of meat at one time with their teeth wolves hunt mainly at night and early in the morning at birth a wolf pup weigh one pound at three week pups start to eat meat each spring wolf have six to fourteen pup which be bear in den a den can be a cave the hollow trunk of a tree a hole that the mother dug or a thicket wolf pack have eight to twenty member the leader call the alpha male always get food first and if anyone butt in they get growl and snarl at wolf communicate by howl tail action and mouth action when wolf cant find food they eat leftover from other kill that they have bury but they can go several week without food pack need to square mile to live in wolf can run up to mile per hour most animal they hunt can run faster but wolf can run tirelessly for hour and can leap as high a one story building wolf use to live all over north america europe and asia but after the s wolf population survive only in northern minnesota and alaska in the united state in canada northern europe and northern asia now they be make a comeback in other area because scientist recognize their important role a apex predator wolf can live in any type of climate except for the desert and the high mountain their color varies from pure white to jet black depend on where they live wolf be fun to watch and listen to now that wolf be start to move back into some of the low state you might hear them howl again,+ if you visit northern + wisconsin dont be surprised to hear the eerie and beautiful howl of wolves at night . + they have returned after about 40 years of absence . + by the 1950s wolves had been driven out of their ancient homeland by ranchers and the federal government . + wolves killed livestock for food so they were considered nuisances . + but starting in the 1990s the state reintroduced wolves to help manage the deer population . + the number of wolves has now rebounded to nearly a thousand . + wolves are relatives to coyotes foxes jackals dingoes and our pet dogs . + some people mistake wolves and coyotes but wolves are much larger and stockier .

6,My little brother is so irritating. All day long he says  Eddie  I wonder why people can talk but animals cant. Or  I wonder why the ocean looks blue. Of course  I dont know the answers  but I dont let him know that. I just make up reasonable explanations  and he accepts them as if Im the smartest person in the world. Before I answer one of his questions  I usually tell him that hes pretty stupid and asks too many questions. Well  yesterday we both got our report cards. I got Bs and Cs  and he got straight As. Under the Comments section on my report card  it said  Eddie would be getting better grades if he asked more questions. Of course  on my brothers report card  it said just the opposite. To make things worse  my brother squawked all day about how I was so stupid for not asking questions! I just sighed and told him he was rightâ€”I wouldnt make fun of him anymore for asking so many questions. Yes  I learned a lesson from my little brother: Never be afraid to ask questions  and NEVER be afraid to wonder why.,my little brother be so irritating all day long he say eddie i wonder why people can talk but animal cant or i wonder why the ocean look blue of course i dont know the answer but i dont let him know that i just make up reasonable explanation and he accept them a if im the smart person in the world before i answer one of his question i usually tell him that hes pretty stupid and ask too many question well yesterday we both get our report card i get b and c and he get straight a under the comment section on my report card it say eddie would be get good grade if he ask more question of course on my brother report card it say just the opposite to make thing bad my brother squawk all day about how i be so stupid for not ask question i just sigh and tell him he be right i wouldnt make fun of him anymore for ask so many question yes i learn a lesson from my little brother never be afraid to ask question and never be afraid to wonder why,+ my little brother is so irritating . + all day long he says + eddie I wonder why people can talk but animals cant . + or I wonder why the ocean looks blue . + of course I dont know the answers but I dont let him know that .

9,Hello. My name is Kim. Im an online-aholic. There. Ive said it. I guess Ive been addicted for quite some time now  but I have just begun to realize it. My first interaction with the Net began when I was only 15 years old. My dad was the computer coordinator at our school  so he wanted to try Internet access at home before installing it at school. We became America Online members in 1993. None of my friends had email back then. My relationship with email started like a Romeo/Juliet conspiracy. I experimented with the Net on the sly at night when the rest of my family was sleeping. Thats when I first created my own screen name. Although I was too young to drive  the locked doors of adolescence were suddenly flung open before me. I could be social in the evening rather than hang out with my familyâ€”the typical family that every adolescent wants to escape from. Hanging out in chat rooms became a nightly ritual. I quickly found friends who would meet me there  give advice for my adolescent problems  and discuss things such as dating  theater  religion  morals  and entertainment. I began to form emotional attachments with these new friends. In fact  I maintained two online relationships for over two years. Raul is a Hispanic teenager living in one of the roughest cities in our nation  Compton  Californiaâ€”the filming location of the 1991 movie Boyz N the Hood. I met Raul in a chat room one night. He sent me an instant message in the middle of a discussion about religion and asked what I believed. My subsequent chats with Raul seemed to have an impact on him and helped me to grow in my own faith. I occasionally took Rauls questions to my preacher or Bible teacher when I needed further explanation. For Rauls 18th birthday  I sent him a Bible that I bought with my paper-route earnings. Raul and I wrote each other for two years  and then Raul had to sell his computer. I havent heard from him since. Brian is a middle-aged high-school theater teacher in Bowie  Maryland. He answered one of my message board posts about an upcoming audition for our schools performance of The Sound of Music. I was 17 years old at the time and greatly desired a part in the musical. Brian had expert advice for how to nail the audition  and as a result I was cast in the role of Maria. Needless to say  we began to communicate regularly via email. My high school drama director had very little experience  so I wrote Brian regarding my struggles with developing character. Brian has written on numerous occasions about coming to see me perform  but it hasnt happened yet. Instead I mail him videos of my performances. We have been writing for four years now  and I never perform without reading advice from him before going on stage. To this day  he is still my mentor  even though Ive never seen a picture of him or heard his voice. Perhaps communicating with my new friends wouldnt have been so bad except that I went online nightly. I remember my mom coming out of her bedroom at 2:00 a.m.  her eyes unaccustomed to the light  her hair tousled from sleep  and her robe wrapped tightly around her cold  sluggish body. What are you still doing up? she would ask. Go to bed! Now that Im 20 years old and in college  not much has changed. I still stay up late writing email  only now I dont have anyone to tell me to go to bed! I can disguise my Internet addiction by going to a computer center and frantically typing away at a computer terminal. Little does everyone else know how often Im not doing school research or paper writing; instead Im aimlessly writing emails or chatting with Internet friends and family hundreds of miles away. The Signs I recently took an online Internet Addiction Test to diagnose the severity of my problem. The test included 10 symptoms of Internet addiction. I evaluated each symptom carefully and related it to my own life. Uses online services everyday without any skipping. Well  yes  this is true. The first thing I do when I wake up every morning is log on and check my email. I have a daily electronic newspaper and weather report waiting for me (delivered at 7:30 a.m. just like our tangible newspaper at home). My computer stays logged on all day  and the last thing I do before I go to bed is check my email again  just in case theres a message waiting for me. I figure  Why let an email wait unopened when I could just as well read it now? Loses track of time after making a connection. This is true of me also. Just the other day I sat down by my computer after classes were done for the day. I had an hour before choir  and a whole pile of reading that needed to be done. Ill just quickly check my mail  I thought  and then Ill do my reading. Instead  I ended up doing email and Internet browsing for the entire hour and was even two minutes late for choir. Countless times Ive said only one more minute to myself or to friends who ask how much longer Ill be playing on the computerâ€”but quite often that minute turns into hours. Goes out less and less. Not true. I still have a very active social life. Perhaps I spend less time on homework due to Internet use  but not less time socializing. Spends less and less time on meals at home or at work  and eats in front of the monitor. Occasionally I eat my lunch in front of my computerâ€”but thats just good time management  isnt it? On these occasions  I am pressed for time to get to my next class  so I eat and do my email at the same time. There is the small problem of crumbs falling into the keyboard or greasy fingers brushing the tops of the keys  but I dont worry about these things when I want to check my email. Denies spending too much time on the Net. What? I dont spend too much time on the Net! Others complain that you spend too much time in front of the monitor. At home  my mom often complained about my time in front of the monitor. While my family watched football around the TV on Sunday afternoons  I had personal chats with friends online. Now that Im away from home  my roommates tease me about my time online. But I acknowledge that I do spend twice (maybe three or four times) as much time online as do all of my other friends and roommates. Checks the electronic mailbox too many times a day. I estimate that I check my email 20-30 times throughout the day. Quite often its just out of habit when I enter or exit my roomâ€”its so easy to click the Get mail button. Perhaps its too accessible for me. I can check my email as a study break in the middle of an assignment  or when I have 10 extra minutes before class. My friends ask if I get discouraged when I check and dont have mail. I dont. Sure  Id like to see new mail appear rather than No new messages on server  but maybe Im used to it by now. With an average of 10 messages received per day  Im used to not having email every time I check. Thinks he or she has the greatest Web site in the world  and dies to give people the URL (Internet address). Nope  not me. I dont have my own Web site. (But if I knew how to create one  I think Id be interested.) Logs onto the Net while already busy at work. In regard to schoolwork  yes  I check my email or go to the Internet several times while busy on other assignments. I find that my Internet use is most frequent when Im procrastinating over an urgent assignment or when Im waiting for an idea to hit me. I dodge the pressure of schoolwork by exercising the power I have online to communicate with others or locate mountains of useless information. Sneaks online with a sense of relief when spouse or family members are not at home. Not anymore. Im pretty open with my time online. However  I do find myself secretly hoping that other people think Im studiousâ€”doing homeworkâ€”rather than writing another measly email. Cold Turkey The results of this Internet Addiction Test indicated that I answered yes to 7 of the 10 symptoms and may very well be addicted to the Net. I was shocked! Sure  I spend more time online than most other people I know do  but I never realized that my time on the computer could become an addiction. It was at this point that essayist Askold Melnyczuks words hit home: Technology is addicting: the habit is hard to break. Like heroin  it feeds on our wish to escape the limits of time and space; and it consumes us. In response to this discovery  I decided to take a 24-hour break from the Netâ€”a standstill on email  instant messages and Web surfing. I told my roommates of my decision and found a sign affixed to my computer screen the next day  holding me to my word: Stay strong  my friend! 24 hours is only one day. You can do it! The clock is tickin! NO EMAIL marathon. The messages will still be thereâ€¦ It wasnt easy going cold turkey. Every time I walked into my bedroom  my hands instantly clenched as that obtrusive sign prevented me from taking a minute to Get mail. While I did go to bed earlierâ€”not allowing myself to check for the latest arriving messages at 1:00 a.m.â€”I hated this moratorium  and I complained about it to my roommates. When the 24 hours were finally up  I ran back to my room and clicked on my cherished Get mail to find 12 new messages waiting. After this 24-hour marathon  I realized that I had real friends in cyberspace. Without the Internet  I compromised my ability to stay in touch with these people. I enjoy communicating through instant messages with my mom and brothers. Just the other night I had three small windows on my screen: one from my brother in California  one from my brother here at college with me  and one from my mom. I was able to chat with all three at the same timeâ€”for free! I guess Im just not quite ready to go cold turkey. Final Evaluation I wonder how many frequent Internet users have taken time to evaluate how the technology has impacted their personal lives. I wonder how many of those who have considered its impact have permanently pulled the plug  cut the wire  and tossed out the computer  and how many others  like myself  took a short vacation  then ran back to the sleeping monitor. Like me  many college students are attracted to the unrestricted  free  and unlimited Internet access available on campuses across the nation. Psychologist Kimberly Young of the University of Pittsburgh-Bradford said  College counselors are starting to see those students who cant stop surfing the Net at the risk of jeopardizing their grades. So far  my problem has not become this big. My grades are not slipping  and I am not in need of counseling. I admit that Im addicted to spending time on the computer  and it is difficult for me to go without it. Yet I refuse to completely reject the medium just because my use of it is somewhat irrational. The Internet provides me with a practical form of communication and offers an easily accessible source of information. I enjoy spending time online. I have not substituted Internet relationships for real-life relationships  and my Internet addiction is not a threat to my financial and emotional security  so I dont see a problem with it. However  if I ever do find that Ive gone over the edge  I know I can email Dr. Young at her Web site (www.addictionrecov.org). Or I can go to a weekly meeting place for Internet addicts  a chat channel called Addictions.com. After all  Internet junkies always know where to turn online for help.,hello my name be kim im an online aholic there ive say it i guess ive be addict for quite some time now but i have just begin to

9,She had finally gotten her green belt in Tae Kwando. It was an amazing accomplishment for Kameelah D.  a thin African American girl standing about five feet tall. Only four years before  she was told by a doctor that she would never walk again. It was quite evident that not only would she walk again  but she would also run  jump  kick  and punch. When Kameelah was 11  a routine physical uncovered an abnormal curvature in her spine. It was soon after diagnosed as scoliosis. Kameelah  as well as her family  was devastated. They were told by the doctor that only 10 percent of all children are afflicted by scoliosis  but her family just couldnt believe Kameelah was a part of that 10 percent. Her first surgery was scheduled immediately. The doctor had the difficult task of reconstructing Kameelahs entire spine and then re-situating her organs around it. I had never been in the hospital for anything serious before  and Id never had surgery  either. I was so scared  Kameelah recalls. She was given something to fall asleep for the surgery  so that she would not feel anything. Because this surgery dealt with the vertebrae and nerve connections to the brain  the doctor had to make sure that Kameelah could still move her body parts right. Therefore  she was awakened in the middle of the surgery. They would ask me to move my fingers  then my toes. I could barely comprehend what was going on. It was bright  and things werent very clear. In retrospect  I cant believe that I was awake while my back was split open  and the doctors had their hands in there. The first surgery was successful  but Kameelah would have to return two more times for the doctor to completely fix the problem. It was at the end of the third surgery when things went wrong . . . really wrong. The doctor inserted a metal rod  which happened to be too small  into Kameelahs back. As a result  it compressed some of the nerves in her spine. She was practically paralyzed from the waist down. Im really very sorry but . . . I dont think Kameelah will ever be able to walk again  the doctor informed her parents. But Kameelahs father  James  as well as Kameelah herself  refused to accept that prediction. Her father  a registered nurse  insisted that the doctor put her in physical therapy and try to rehabilitate her. He insisted that he be there  too  along with the therapist  helping to rehabilitate his daughter. But the doctor wouldnt oblige. He said that it was a lost cause  and that he knew that Kameelah could never walk again. I was really scared. I just remember telling Dad  â€˜I have to walk. I have to walk  Dad. And he promised me  he swore to me  that I would walk again. He said just what I needed to hear. James kept his promise. He brought Kameelah home in a wheelchair and worked with her  doing exercises that would have been ridiculously easy for any other person  but that were excruciatingly difficult for Kameelah. After about a year  Kameelah was miraculously able to walk with a walker. In no time  she even got strong enough to get along without the walker. Eventually  she walked confidently  and even ran steadily. Now  at the age of twenty-two  she can execute a flying sidekick with the greatest of ease. Not bad for someone who was told she would never walk again  huh? she jokes.,she have finally get her green belt in tae kwando it be an amazing accomplishment for kameelah d a thin african american girl stand about five foot tall only four year before she be tell by a doctor that she would never walk again it be quite evident that not only would she walk again but she would also run jump kick and punch when kameelah be a routine physical uncover an abnormal curvature in her spine it be soon after diagnose a scoliosis kameelah as well a her family be devastate they be tell by the doctor that only percent of all child be afflict by scoliosis but her family just couldnt believe kameelah be a part of that percent her first surgery be schedule immediately the doctor have the difficult task of reconstruct kameelahs entire spine and then re situate her organ around it i have never be in the hospital for anything serious before and id never have surgery either i be so scared kameelah recall she be give something to fall asleep for the surgery so that she would not feel anything because this surgery dealt with the vertebra and nerve connection to the brain the doctor have to make sure that kameelah could still move her body part right therefore she be awaken in the middle of the surgery they would ask me to move my finger then my toe i could barely comprehend what be go on it be bright and thing werent very clear in retrospect i cant believe that i be awake while my back be split open and the doctor have their hand in there the first surgery be successful but kameelah would have to return two more time for the doctor to completely fix the problem it be at the end of the third surgery when thing go wrong really wrong the doctor insert a metal rod which happen to be too small into kameelahs back a a result it compress some of the nerve in her spine she be practically paralyze from the waist down im really very sorry but i dont think kameelah will ever be able to walk again the doctor inform her parent but kameelahs father james as well a kameelah herself refuse to accept that prediction her father a registered nurse insist that the doctor put her in physical therapy and try to rehabilitate her he insist that he be there too along with the therapist help to rehabilitate his daughter but the doctor wouldnt oblige he say that it be a lose cause and that he know that kameelah could never walk again i be really scared i just remember tell dad i have to walk i have to walk dad and he promise me he swear to me that i would walk again he say just what i need to hear james keep his promise he bring kameelah home in a wheelchair and work with her do exercise that would have be ridiculously easy for any other person but that be excruciatingly difficult for kameelah after about a year kameelah be miraculously able to walk with a walker in no time she even get strong enough to get along without the walker eventually she walk confidently and even run steadily now at the age of twenty two she can execute a fly sidekick with the great of ease not bad for someone who be tell she would never walk again huh she joke,+ she had finally gotten her green belt in + tae + kwando . + it was an amazing accomplishment for + kameelah D . a thin + african + american girl standing about five feet tall . + only four years before she was told by a doctor that she would never walk again . + it was quite evident that not only would she walk again but she would also run jump kick and punch . + when + kameelah was 11 a routine physical uncovered an abnormal curvature in her spine . + it was soon after diagnosed as scoliosis . + kameelah as well as her family was devastated . + they were told by the doctor that only 10 percent of all children are afflicted by scoliosis but her family just couldnt believe + kameelah was a part of that 10 percent . + her first surgery was scheduled immediately . + the doctor had the difficult task of reconstructing + kameelahs entire spine and then re - situating her organs around it .

9,Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder that I struggled with for the majority of my middle school years and a portion of my high school years. My classmates at Riverview High School were aware of my disorder  and it greatly affected the way they treated me. At the start of my junior year  I transferred to Madison High School. I decided not to tell anyone at that school about my eating disorder since I was mostly recovered by that time. Even though my friends at Riverview and Madison all showed concern for my well-being  their approaches differed greatly  especially in lunchroom behavior  conversation  and individual opinions about my personality and character. At Riverview  lunchtime was usually a nightmare for me. I would enter the cafeteria  and in my mind  all eyes would fix themselves upon my gangly figure. I would take my place at a table full of friends and try to enjoy a normal lunch. The problem was that I would not always eat lunch  and that greatly concerned my friends. They would watch to make sure that I was eating properly  almost forcing food into my mouth. Sometimes I would pretend to eat and then drop pieces of food into a napkin and throw it out with the trash. When some of my friends found out  they were furious  which seemed to cause even more trouble. Lunch was obviously not my favorite time of the day  and it involved a lot of stress. Strangely  I stopped dreading lunch when I started at Madison. No one knew that I had an eating disorder  so they did not care what I ate. This lifted an enormous amount of stress from my life. I finally had the freedom to eat what I wanted without being harassed. It was still hard for me to eat in front of other people  which is common for anorexics  but I was able to put some of my fears aside. I began to enjoy lunch instead of disposing of it. With my Riverview friends  instead of chatting about boys and other girl things  we would discuss my disorder. Girls would follow me into the bathroom  and instead of styling their hair  they would check to see if I was throwing up. We never got to gossip together like normal middle-school girls because we had to focus on anorexia instead. All I really wanted to talk about was how cute Mike Reynolds looked that day. I was totally shocked to find that all the life-and-death conversations disappeared when I went to Madison. It was so much fun to talk about the little things that occurred in everyday life. The subject of eating disorders rarely came up  and when it did  I was not the focus. I loved having the freedom to go into the bathroom without being followed. High school is meant to be filled with frivolous chatter  and at Madison I participated in more than my fair share. I found that the students at Riverview had made many generalizations about my character  and their behavior was guided by those generalizations. Their natural instincts told them to help me. I appreciated their concern  but they never took the time to find out who I was as a person. They knew me only as an anorexic. My friends cared about my health  but they failed to care about me. Truthfully  all I wanted was for them to love me for me and not to obsess over my shortcomings. The people at Madison took the time to know who I really was. They had no idea that I had been an anorexic  so that particular stereotype did not color their opinions of me. I was finally recognized for my talents and achievements  not my failures. I was honored as a good student. I was also honored as a cheerleader  and no one cared how I looked in my skirt. I could finally be viewed as a real person. I liked the way that people saw me at Madison  and I was no longer afraid to show my true character and personality. My days as an anorexic taught me many lessons that I would not trade for the world. They taught me about life and how to be a better friend. I learned about the joys of routine tasks such as eating lunch. I learned to appreciate the simple things in life like the gossip shared by a group of teenage girls. I gained an understanding of what true character is. I hold no grudges against those who so desperately tried to help me. In fact  I owe them a great debt. And I appreciate the people who helped me to see that there is more to life than having an eating disorder. ,anorexia nervosa be an eat disorder that i struggle with for the majority of my middle school year and a portion of my high school year my classmate at riverview high school be aware of my disorder and it greatly affect the way they treat me at the start of my junior year i transfer to madison high school i decide not to tell anyone at that school about my eating disorder since i be mostly recover by that time even though my friend at riverview and madison all show concern for my well be their approach differ greatly especially in lunchroom behavior conversation and individual opinion about my personality and character at riverview lunchtime be usually a nightmare for me i would enter the cafeteria and in my mind all eye would fix themselves upon my gangly figure i would take my place at a table full of friend and try to enjoy a normal lunch the problem be that i would not always eat lunch and that greatly concerned my friend they would watch to make sure that i be eat properly almost force food into my mouth sometimes i would pretend to eat and then drop piece of food into a napkin and throw it out with the trash when some of my friend find out they be furious which seem to cause even more trouble lunch be obviously not my favorite time of the day and it involve a lot of stress strangely i stop dread lunch when i start at madison no one know that i have an eating disorder so they do not care what i eat this lift an enormous amount of stress from my life i finally have the freedom to eat what i want without be harass it be still hard for me to eat in front of other people which be common for anorexic but i be able to put some of my fear aside i begin to enjoy lunch instead of dispose of it with my riverview friend instead of chat about boy and other girl thing we would discuss my disorder girl would follow me into the bathroom and instead of style their hair they would check to see if i be throw up we never get to gossip together like normal middle school girl because we have to focus on anorexia instead all i really want to talk about be how cute mike reynolds look that day i be totally shocked to find that all the life and death conversation disappear when i go to madison it be so much fun to talk about the little thing that occur in everyday life the subject of eat disorder rarely come up and when it do i be not the focus i love have the freedom to go into the bathroom without be follow high school be mean to be fill with frivolous chatter and at madison i participate in more than my fair share i find that the student at riverview have make many generalization about my character and their behavior be guide by those generalization their natural instinct tell them to help me i appreciate their concern but they never take the time to find out who i be a a person they know me only a an anorexic my friend care about my health but they fail to care about me truthfully all i want be for them to love me for me and not to obsess over my shortcoming the people at madison take the time to know who i really be they have no idea that i have be an anorexic so that particular stereotype do not color their opinion of me i be finally recognize for my talent and achievement not my failure i be honor a a good student i be also honor a a cheerleader and no one care how i look in my skirt i could finally be view a a real person i like the way that people saw me at madison and i be no long afraid to show my true character and personality my day a an anorexic teach me many lesson that i would not trade for the world they teach me about life and how to be a good friend i learn about the joy of routine task such a eat lunch i learn to appreciate the simple thing in life like the gossip share by a group of teenage girl i gain an understanding of what true character be i hold no grudge against those who so desperately try to help me in fact i owe them a great debt and i appreciate the people who help me to see that there be more to life than have an eating disorder,+ anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder that I struggled with for the majority of my middle school years and a portion of my high school years . + my classmates at + riverview + high + school were aware of my disorder and it greatly affected the way they treated me . + at the start of my junior year I transferred to + madison + high + school .

9,What should be done with a herd of marauding elephants? This was the problem recently confronting officials at Pilanesberg National Park in South Africa. A number of orphaned male elephants had been transported to the park in order to provide them with a safe and nurturing environment. However  this step to protect the elephant population soon threatened another endangered species. The young elephants had entered musth  like puberty  a state of heightened hormonal activity and increased aggression. The elephants went on a killing spree  slaying almost 40 rhinocerosâ€”including incredibly rare black rhinos. The park officials did not want to kill the young elephants  but they could not afford to have any more rhinos slaughtered. Oddly enough  the solution to this disastrous situation was to bring more male elephants into the park. This time  however  they were full-grown bull elephants. In almost no time at all  a previously impossible hierarchy had been established  and the orphaned males fell right into place. No more rhino killings were reported. The Pilanesberg story had a positive ending  but many elephants are not as lucky. The elephant population in Africa has been drastically reduced by loss of habitat to cultivation and urbanization  and many have been orphaned by poachers cashing in on the illegal ivory trade. Some biologists believe that if elephant numbers continue to drop  it will soon be impossible to save the species. Elephants are amazing creatures. As well as holding the title of largest land animal  they are also among the most intelligent. An elephant has 150 000 muscle units in its trunk  can swim long distances without tiring  walks almost silently despite weighing about 7 tons  can travel up to 6 000 miles in a year while searching for food  and can live 60 years. Full-grown elephants have no natural enemies  other than humans. Like most animals  elephants have an enormous effect on the other animals in their habitat. Eating 165-330 pounds of food a day  an elephant can clear thick brush into open savannah in no time  creating an open habitat for other animals. Several tree species rely almost solely on elephants to scatter their seeds. If the elephant were to disappear  these life-forms would bear the consequences. With only 2 elephant species left out of 600  the danger of extinction is imminent. If the population in any particular area drops below 100 individuals (as it has in several parks)  that population is virtually doomed  having entered an extinction vortex. Continued inbreeding leads to genetic deterioration  which results in fewer reproductive males and females being born. The numbers begin to drop  and the cycle continues until the population completely dies out. Evidence of this genetic deterioration can be seen in elephant tusks  which are gradually becoming smaller. All elephants with exceptionally large tusks have already been poached. Humans have always taken advantage of the incredible strength and endurance of elephants. Hannibal  the Carthaginian general  used elephants to carry his supplies across the Alps in the third century. Elephants have been ridden onto the battlefield  have been trained to carry heavy logs  and were even used during World War II to drag military equipment up steep slopes. We have used elephants to our advantage for more than 2 000 years. Now we are destroying them. Poaching is the chief reason that elephants are brought closer to extinction every day. From 1986 to 1989 300 000 African elephants were killed for their ivory tusks. In 1986 alone  75 percent of raw ivory came from illegal poachingâ€”the equivalent of 89 000 elephants. Recently  laws have been instituted that completely ban any hunting of the endangered elephants. However  this has only made poaching easier; without professional hunters carefully patrolling their favorite hunting blocks  park rangers alone are left to deal with poachers. Carrying outdated World War II rifles  the rangers are no match for ruthless poachers with AK-17s  who have been known to kill rangers  local farmers  and even tourists to avoid capture. The poaching trade began in earnest in 1971  when a severe drought killed 9 000 elephants in a Kenyan game reserve. Neighbors of the park moved in to collect ivory. They found it was very profitable  and when the supply dwindled and they could no longer simply pick it up from the ground  they turned to the living elephants. In 1973 there were 167 000 elephants in Kenya. By 1987  there were only 20 000 left. Raw ivory is shipped by smugglers to factories where it is either carved into sculptures or converted into Chinese medicines (which may actually have very little medicinal value). Criminals in a Gang of Eight nations conduct this lucrative trade: ivory is smuggled out of Kenya  Tanzania  and Uganda through middlemen in Vietnam  Malaysia  and the Philippines  and then smuggled into China and Thailand. The demand for ivoryâ€”as well as the price paid to poachers  smugglers  and middlemenâ€”has increased over the years  in some places by 1000 percent. Weapons are also more available due to the civil wars and political unrest in certain African countries. These factors have contributed to increased poaching and will ultimately contribute to the demise of elephants. Many attempts have been made to stamp out poaching in African game reserves  but law enforcement has proved extremely difficult. Lack of funding for conservation projects and for staff to patrol the parks is a major obstacle in the quest to protect threatened species. In addition  many poachers are not the professionals seen on TV  with trucks full of supplies  traps  and technologically advanced weapons. Instead  they come from poor communities adjacent to major parks. The people in these communities have to put up with harassment from wild animals  and they rarely get anything in return. Consequently  they do not object to making some money at the expense of an elephant or two. The scenario is common in the poor countries of Africa  such as Kenya  where 30 million hungry people are crowded into an area the size of Texas. Officials in Zimbabwe and Botswana have tried to remedy this problem in an interesting fashion. They granted ownership of all the wild animals in a certain area to the nearest village or community. Contrary to public expectations  this method was relatively successful. The communities managed resources carefully  monitored their animals well  and even earned money from safari expeditions. Safaris turned out to pay better than trophy hunting. For every trophy hunter who paid a small fortune to shoot a single animal  hundreds of thousands of tourists paid a large fortune to look at the animal. Unfortunately  community ownership of animals seemed to work only in areas with large areas of land and few people. Another approach taken to prevent peasants from turning to poaching was to use money generated by park tourism to build clinics and provide educational programs for surrounding communities. However  because some parks do not attract as many tourists as others do  and also because of the sheer number of poor villages  the benefits were spread too thinly. In recent years  the number of elephant killings due to poaching has decreased  largely due to the worldwide ban (since 1990) on the trade of ivory. However  the illegal trade continues  and as long as it does  poachers will be a part of it. The poaching problem is incredibly intricate. Fueled by the illicit trade to southeast Asia and the rest of the world  it is also the result of a lack of education and public services in African villages. It is evident that a single country cannot successfully combat poaching and the loss of elephant habitat. The world needs to unite like never before if we want to save our remaining elephants.,what should be do with a herd of maraud elephant this be the problem recently confront official at pilanesberg

9,Youve got to know your own value  know what you want  and stick with it. Thats what T. McDowells advice to others is  and its certainly worked for him. This high school senior is currently the sole owner of Immersion Immaging  a successful company specializing in Internet commerce solutions and online financial databasing. McDowell began the company in 2012  although it was originally called 4th Dimension Graphics. Two years later  the company was reorganized as Immersion Immaging. Surprisingly  he didnt begin the company with the assistance of any partners  but instead founded it on his own with the experience and contacts that he already had. Its always been a one-person operation  and its going to stay that way for a while. I could easily take on partners or expand the business some more  but I want to keep it this way for now  McDowell said. Even now  McDowell does everything himself  from marketing and management to the actual coding that he writes for his clients Web sites. I remember one time that I worked for over 800 hours on one site and never really got paid for it. Ive learned since then  McDowell said. Thus far  he has worked for such companies as Online Devices International  Greystone Peripherals  and Publicard  Inc. He works on Web site design along with Internet marketing solutions and other aspects of Internet commerce. I dont have any lack of contracts right now. I like it because its flexible  so that if I need more income  I can get the business I need; and if I take a break for a while  I dont have any problems  McDowell said. Spending between 30 and 60 hours a week at his business  Immersion Immaging  provides him with a steady income  although he admits that it takes up much of his free time. A lot of the time [on the business] is spent after school and late at night  and my parents dont really like that too much. Otherwise  though  theyre really supportive of the whole thing  McDowell said. Part of the reason McDowell ended up in the computer industry might be explained by the exposure he had as a child. Even as a teenager  most of his friends were older and connected to the computer industry. Even though Im younger than most other people in the technology business  it hasnt mattered much. A lot of my friends throughout my life have been older than me  so Im used to it  McDowell said. In his freshman year  McDowell worked at a company called PC Powercomp and familiarized himself with the business and the technical aspects of it. Having already started learning various online languages at the beginning of junior high school  McDowell was well prepared to enter this field. When I started out with computers  it was mainly because I didnt have much else to do; so it was a good way to use my time  and its turned out to be pretty good  McDowell said. However  he spends his free time on more than just computers. His real interest lies in aviation  which he has pursued for more than six years.

9,Not all thieves lurk in dark alleys and parks. Some sit with their faces lit by the glow of their computer monitors  copying  pasting  and printing. It may seem like just another helpful source of information  but the Internet has taken the theft of intellectual property to a new level. Part of the problem is that most students dont really know the exact definition of plagiarism or its consequences. Some say that using someone elses ideas without attributing them is a form of theft  but most people dont think of it as a serious crime. For teachers  Internet plagiarism has been especially problematic compared to theft from other sources. This is because it is so difficult to locate the origin of Internet material. To counter student plagiarism  Internet services designed to detect copied material have emerged to aid teachers. One company  TurnItIn.com  has developed a system for detecting material plagiarized from the Internet. Teachers can upload student works onto the site  which searches for similarities to material from all over the Web. The teachers then receive an originality report. To utilize this technology  teachers have students submit all papers electronically. The threat of using [these programs] will stop a lot of students. They will be afraid theyll be caught. Unfortunately  fear is what works  English teacher Judy Grear said. English teacher Barbara Swovelin said  With all the info thats on the Internet  its understandable that we go to it to get information. Its understandable that people would use it as a resource. The legal and moral issues come in when students use it improperly. A main concern is not only the use of a few plagiarized sentences  but of entire papers. Paper mills like SchoolSucks.com and Evil House of Cheat are some of the most popular sources for pirated papers. Sites like these  which have achieved fame and notoriety among slackers everywhere  were the motivation for TurnItIn.com and similar sites. In addition to such blatant cut and paste plagiarism  most teachers agree that students must be wary of the theft of ideas. One plagiarism-detection program  Word Check  asserts through their Web site  Whether you agree or disagree on how information should be used or reused in digital form  one thing is clear: protecting intellectual property from theft and infringement is the number one security issue. By some definitions  it seems like everyone plagiarizes. But for many students who feel that they might unknowingly plagiarize  programs like TurnItIn.com are intimidating. The detection system on TurnItIn.com  which is a part of plagiarism.org  claims to detect plagiarism down to the eight-word level  which many fear could include accidental lifting of words. You might lift an idea or a line or two. Everybody does that. Some writers dont read other writers because of it  Grear said. Swovelin responds positively to the new technology that detection programs use. What we would try to produce would be students who would be ethical. People learn lessons when they do something wrong  she said about the program. I think that the idea is good  Chris M.  a senior  said. But it might be a little extreme because some phrases are common enough that they might be in more than one essay. The thieves are out there  and they arent wearing stocking caps. Theyre not robbing banks; theyre stealing words.,not all thief lurk in dark alley and park some sit with their face light by the glow of their computer monitor copy pasting and print it may seem like just another helpful source of information but the internet have take the theft of intellectual property to a new level part of the problem be that most student dont really know the exact definition of plagiarism or it consequence some say that use someone elses idea without attribute them be a form of theft but most people dont think of it a a serious crime for teacher internet plagiarism have be especially problematic compare to theft from other source this be because it be so difficult to locate the origin of internet material to counter student plagiarism internet service design to detect copy material have emerge to aid teacher one company turnitin com have develop a system for detect material plagiarize from the internet teacher can upload student work onto the site which search for similarity to material from all over the web the teacher then receive an originality report to utilize this technology teacher have student submit all paper electronically the threat of use these program will stop a lot of student they will be afraid theyll be catch unfortunately fear be what work english teacher judy grear say english teacher barbara swovelin say with all the info thats on the internet it understandable that we go to it to get information it understandable that people would use it a a resource the legal and moral issue come in when student use it improperly a main concern be not only the use of a few plagiarized sentence but of entire paper paper mill like schoolsucks com and evil house of cheat be some of the most popular source for pirated paper site like these which have achieve fame and notoriety among slacker everywhere be the motivation for turnitin com and similar site in addition to such blatant cut and paste plagiarism most teacher agree that student must be wary of the theft of idea one plagiarism detection program word check assert through their web site whether you agree or disagree on how information should be use or reuse in digital form one thing be clear protect intellectual property from theft and infringement be the number one security issue by some definition it seem like everyone plagiarizes but for many student who feel that they might unknowingly plagiarize program like turnitin com be intimidate the detection system on turnitin com which be a part of plagiarism org claim to detect plagiarism down to the eight word level which many fear could include accidental lifting of word you might lift an idea or a line or two everybody do that some writer dont read other writer because of it grear say swovelin responds positively to the new technology that detection program use what we would try to produce would be student who would be ethical people learn lesson when they do something wrong she say about the program i think that the idea be good chris m a senior say but it might be a little extreme because some phrase be common enough that they might be in more than one essay the thief be out there and they arent wear stock cap theyre not rob bank theyre steal word,+ not all thieves lurk in dark alleys and parks . + some sit with their faces lit by the glow of their computer monitors copying pasting and printing . + it may seem like just another helpful source of information but the + internet has taken the theft of intellectual property to a new level . + part of the problem is that most students dont really know the exact definition of plagiarism or its consequences . + some say that using someone elses ideas without attributing them is a form of theft but most people dont think of it as a serious crime . + for teachers + internet plagiarism has been especially problematic compared to theft from other sources . + this is because it is so difficult to locate the origin of + internet material . + to counter student plagiarism + internet services designed to detect copied material have emerged to aid teachers . + one company *url has developed a system for detecting material plagiarized from the + internet . + teachers can upload student works onto the site which searches for similarities to material from all over the + web . + the teachers then receive an originality report . + to utilize this technology teachers have students submit all papers electronically . + the threat of using [ these programs ] will stop a lot of students . + they will be afraid theyll be caught . + unfortunately fear is what works + english teacher + judy + grear said . + english teacher + barbara + swovelin said + with all the info thats on the + internet its understandable that we go to it to get information . + its understandable that people would use it as a resource . + the legal and moral issues come in when students use it improperly .

9,Im drifting off to sleep  listening to the summer nights breeze rustling the leaves on the oak outside my window. Peaceful. Dreamy. Safe. Im almost asleep when a loud buzzing sound fills my ear. A disturbing annoyance cancels all thoughts of sleep  disturbs all peace. Buzzzzzzzz...buzzzzzzzz...buzzzzzzz. Only a mosquito can make that sound. How did it get in here? Buzzzzz...buzzzzzzz. I swat and slap at this annoying creature. Ill get it; I know I will. Ill knock it down in midair and put it out of its misery. That itsy-bitsy pest cant survive my powerful swipes. So I swing to the left  to the right  above my head  over my stomach  everywhere. I dont miss an inch of the darkness. Nothing could survive this extreme attack of mine! I probably look like a crazed wind turbine. There  Im certain now it has to be dead. I had to hit it  with my arms flying everywhere swatting and swiping. It is probably knocked dead  somewhere on the floor . . . Ill just clean it up in the morning. Slowly my panting ebbs. Tranquility is returning. Then I realize my body is tensing  tensing. It is becoming so tense my muscles start to weaken. It must be tense because I am listening  listening. Im listening so hard my ears feel like theyre twitching. Silence. Blessed silence. No nasty creature here to bother me anymore. The breeze rustles the leaves; Im on some beachâ€”azure water  giant white clouds like full-blooming magnolias  warm sand. Suddenly  I snap awake: buzzzzzzz... buzzzzzz... buzzzzzz. No! No! No! Okay  this time I will get it. I swing my feet onto the floor  turn on the light  pick up a T-shirt  and listen. Nothing. I peer everywhere like an eagle. Eagle Eye they should call meâ€”I dont miss anything. But  I look carefully into the light  and . . . nothing. Do lights attract mosquitoes? I think so. I scan the walls  the ceiling  my T-shirt gripped as hard as possible ready for the assault. Nothing. Silence. I watch the light. I stand still  listening and ready. Nothing. Silence. I wait  stiff as a board. Still nothing. I decide to crawl back into bed  leaving the light on. I cling to the T-shirt. If that tiny pest is still in the vicinity  the light will attract it  and then I shall swat it  and then finally I shall have a peaceful nights rest. I wait  listen. A car goes by. The breeze rustles the leaves. How can I hear the buzz with all this racket? I get out of bed  close the window  get back into bed  and pick up my deadly weapon. Yes  now I can hear better; I am ready. The breeze wont disturb me now. I listen. I wait. First  I lie on my back. I can scan the space in my room now. Eagle Eye  thats me. I tune up both ears to 100 percent capacity. This is good. I was born ready for this adventurous game. I feel my back growing stiff. Suddenly I am not comfortable on my back anymore. I need to turn. Ill turn toward the light. The light should attract this pestering nuisance. All I really need to do is watch the space around the lamp. I wad up the T-shirt. New strategy. Good strategy. Im ready and waiting. One swipe and this war will be over. That mosquito will never bother anyone ever again. Then I see it  clinging to the wall like super glue  waiting for me to just smack it. On the count of three  I am going to kill it. One . . . two . . . THREE! SWAT! SWAP! SMACK! SWIPE! Ahhhhhh  at last! Finally  Ive put that little bug out of its miseryâ€”and out of mine. And I guess Ill just clean it up (along with the broken lamp) in the morning.,im drift off to sleep listening to the summer night breeze rustle the leaf on the oak outside my window peaceful dreamy safe im almost asleep when a loud buzzing sound fill my ear a disturbing annoyance cancel all thought of sleep disturbs all peace buzzzzzzzz buzzzzzzzz buzzzzzzz only a mosquito can make that sound how do it get in here buzzzzz buzzzzzzz i swat and slap at this annoy creature ill get it i know i will ill knock it down in midair and put it out of it misery that itsy bitsy pest cant survive my powerful swipe so i swing to the left to the right above my head over my stomach everywhere i dont miss an inch of the darkness nothing could survive this extreme attack of mine i probably look like a crazed wind turbine there im certain now it have to be dead i have to hit it with my arm fly everywhere swat and swipe it be probably knock dead somewhere on the floor ill just clean it up in the morning slowly my pant ebbs tranquility be return then i realize my body be tense tense it be become so tense my muscle start to weaken it must be tense because i be listen listen im listen so hard my ear feel like theyre twitch silence bless silence no nasty creature here to bother me anymore the breeze rustle the leaf im on some beach azure water giant white cloud like full blooming magnolia warm sand suddenly i snap awake buzzzzzzz buzzzzzz buzzzzzz no no no okay this time i will get it i swing my foot onto the floor turn on the light pick up a t shirt and listen nothing i peer everywhere like an eagle eagle eye they should call me i dont miss anything but i look carefully into the light and nothing do light attract mosquito i think so i scan the wall the ceiling my t shirt grip as hard a possible ready for the assault nothing silence i watch the light i stand still listen and ready nothing silence i wait stiff a a board still nothing i decide to crawl back into bed leave the light on i cling to the t shirt if that tiny pest be still in the vicinity the light will attract it and then i shall swat it and then finally i shall have a peaceful night rest i wait listen a car go by the breeze rustle the leaf how can i hear the buzz with all this racket i get out of bed close the window get back into bed and pick up my deadly weapon yes now i can hear good i be ready the breeze wont disturb me now i listen i wait first i lie on my back i can scan the space in my room now eagle eye thats me i tune up both ear to percent capacity this be good i be bear ready for this adventurous game i feel my back grow stiff suddenly i be not comfortable on my back anymore i need to turn ill turn toward the light the light should attract this pestering nuisance all i really need to do be watch the space around the lamp i wad up the t shirt new strategy good strategy im ready and wait one swipe and this war will be over that mosquito will never bother anyone ever again then i see it cling to the wall like super glue wait for me to just smack it on the count of three i be go to kill it one two three swat swap smack swipe ahhhhhh at last finally ive put that little bug out of it misery and out of mine and i guess ill just clean it up along with the broken lamp in the morning,+ im drifting off to sleep listening to the summer nights breeze rustling the leaves on the oak outside my window . + peaceful . + dreamy . + safe . + im almost asleep when a loud buzzing sound fills my ear .

0,The Great Ship Once there was a ship. It went farther than any ship in the world. One day there was a ship race. But the ship owner got up late in the day and the ship race started early in the day so he got an alarm clock. The next day was the ship race and he got up early. The next day the ship race began and he won the ship race and he won a golden cap and he also became a great fisherman. That night he dreamt that he was the best fisherman in the world. He dreamt he caught a shark and it swallowed him but the next day he caught all the fish he wanted and he lived all his life.

2,The Mariners Game On Saturday  May 23 1998  I went to a Mariners game. It was the Seattle Mariners vs. the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. The score was Mariners 3 Devils Rays 7. The Devil Rays hurt us bad. I got disgusted because we lost. The best part was when I got my giraffe beanie baby signed by Alex Roderiguez. The baddest part was when the Devil Rays got ahead. At the beginning my mom blurted out Hi Alex. He grinned  looked up and said Hi. For the rest of the game  my mom kept her eyes on Alex Roderiguez. At the Kingdome  I ate some Twix candy bars. This woman  behind us  named Dana  was crazy about Dan Wilson. She liked him so much she says hes a beautiful thing. DAN WILSON. Dana screamed  go Danny.

2,By where me and Danielle live  they had a drug bust. Drug Busts are when police come and search drug dealers houses. It is very scary when they have a drug bust because you could get stolen by a drug dealer and never come back. So lock your doors when they have a drug bust around where you live. It was closer to Danielles house. It was kind of close to Davids house. It was really close to Kasey Bells and Katie Bells and Kelsey Bells house because they live less than ten yards away. It was boring because you had to stay inside. You couldnt take one baby step outside.

2,Ashes filled the air when I was around the camp fire. Crackle  crackle  it went. Ashes flew up in to the air and once they got too high and it got too cold. And they disappeared. At first they were red burning hot. I roasted hot dogs and marshmallows and I like mine burnt because it gives it more taste some time. I like to peel the burnt stuff off of the marshmallows because there is melty stuff in side of it. I make smores out of it because it is squishier so it is easier to squish it. It tastes better. When you put water on the fire it goes sizzle sizzle and it sparks. Oh Yeah! Here is some thing really funny. My hair still smells like smoke.

3,I got this assignment to do. I had to write about an event that I regretted. But I didnt do it. I didnt tell my parents about it. Meanwhile  Ms. Stromberg asked me every day about this assignment. I didnt do this assignment because I couldnt think of anything to write about. I didnt ask my mom for help  because I thought she would get mad at me. When Ms. Stromberg asked me about my work  I just rolled my eyes. I hoped it would go away. However  what did happen  was Ms. Stromberg sent home a note which I didnt give to my parents. Finally  Ms. Stromberg talked to my mom about it. When my mom heard about this  she got mad and hurt. She was mad because I didnt do my work  and hurt because I thought she would get mad at me if I asked for help. I had to do this work until my parents were satisfied. I didnt get any books all weekend and no TV all Friday. I got very mad. I got so mad  I didnt think Id ever read again. I feel totally dumb. I should have gone to my parents for help.

3,The day after Thanksgiving my family had a reunion for my grandmother on a boat because she died of cancer about a month ago. We were all sitting in a circle  reading letters about her and saying memories. Then from oldest to youngest  we went outside  and threw a rose and a cup of grandmothers ashes out into the water. I asked if I could go alone so I could have a special time with grandmother. When it was my turn I went outside  said a few words and threw the rose. Then I picked up the cup and filled it with ashes. But I threw the ashes a little crooked and they fell on the bumpers  and because the wind was very hard the ashes blew back all over me and the boat. Everyone inside was laughing really hard  I was even laughing myself! I thought it was because of what happened. But then my mom told me that she did the same thing to my grandfather 4 years ago. She said that she had twisted her hand a little  and it all flew back all over her and my aunt Shelly. That made me laugh even harder  and my mom said that grandma Jin always liked a good laugh! I think everyone got a good laugh. A little bit later I got to have the extra roses to throw outside and say what I wanted to say. I had a wonderful time that day.,the day after thanksgiving my family have a reunion for my grandmother on a boat because she die of cancer about a month ago we be all sit in a circle reading letter about her and say memory then from old to youngest we go outside and throw a rise and a cup of grandmother ash out into the water i ask if i could go alone so i could have a special time with grandmother when it be my turn i go outside say a few word and throw the rise then i pick up the cup and fill it with ash but i throw the ash a little crooked and they fell on the bumper and because the wind be very hard the ash blow back all over me and the boat everyone inside be laugh really hard i be even laugh myself i think it be because of what happen but then my mom tell me that she do the same thing to my grandfather year ago she say that she have twist her hand a little and it all fly back all over her and my aunt shelly that make me laugh even hard and my mom say that grandma jin always like a good laugh i think everyone get a good laugh a little bit later i get to have the extra rose to throw outside and say what i want to say i have a wonderful time that day,+ the day after + thanksgiving my family had a reunion for my grandmother on a boat because she died of cancer about a month ago . + we were all sitting in a circle reading letters about her and saying memories . + then from oldest to youngest we went outside and threw a rose and a cup of grandmothers ashes out into the water .

3,It was a snowy day in January. It was a Surprise Snowstorm with about 6 inches of snow. Grandma and grandpa came over from Ellensburg. Mom and grandma went to a baby shower and my sister Julia had our friend Lil over. Our grandpa wanted to see my dads jobsite and we had to go over Whitney Bridge hill to get there. The roads were very icey so when we got to the top of the hill  I felt a big lurch and dad yelled hold on! But it was to late. We slid into the ditch. Two other cars slid to the side of the road. Grandpas truck did too  a few yards ahead of us. Dad got out of our truck to go help put chains on grandpas tires. But when he got in  the chains fell off and the truck skreeched and slid to the bottom of the hill. Dads trucks tire had popped off  so dad  Dyllan (my other sister) Lil  Julia and I jumped down from it toward grandpa at the bottom of the hill. I sat in the sled with Dyllan to calm her  dad pulled us and Julia and Lil carried grandpas chains. We started down the hill and a big truck passed by. When we started walking again  I slid on my knees in between some abandoned cars by the road. I felt the cars moving and one hit my head. I could not do anything but crawl through the tires to the ditch on the other side. Quickly  a man pulled me out. I learned that the big truck had bumped into the cars causing them to move. Everyone was okay. Julia and Lil had been in front of the cars. Grandpa gave anyone who wanted one a ride and dropped them off where they wanted to go. Then we went home.

3,Screech  screech  screech! The first time we tried to play the recorders it sounded like a lion running his claws down a chalkboard. In other words we made a TERRIBLE noise! See  a recorder is an instrument with a very high pitch. If you dont blow in it correctly  it does sound pretty bad. After Mrs. Romland told us there is a special place for our tongue to be  we understood why we sounded so bad. She said the place was right behind your upper front teeth  and then she said once your tongue is there  put the recorder up to your mouth and try to say too  too  too  too. Its called tonguing. Then we almost got the right sound. A recorder looks like a short skinny tube with one hole on the bottom  and 7 holes on the top. There are a few different types of recorders. The one we are playing is called the soprano  it is the smallest with the highest sound. Another is the alto  it is bigger with a lower sound. Next comes the tenor  it is bigger yet  with an even lower sound. Last but not least is the bass  it is the biggest of them all and the lowest sounding too. The recorder originally came from Europe. It has been an instrument for over 100 years. If you think it is related to the flute  its not.  ,screech screech screech the first time we try to play the recorder it sound like a lion run his claw down a chalkboard in other word we make a terrible noise see a recorder be an instrument with a very high pitch if you dont blow in it correctly it do sound pretty bad after mr romland tell u there be a special place for our tongue to be we understood why we sound so bad she say the place be right behind your upper front teeth and then she say once your tongue be there put the recorder up to your mouth and try to say too too too too it call tonguing then we almost get the right sound a recorder look like a short skinny tube with one hole on the bottom and hole on the top there be a few different type of recorder the one we be play be call the soprano it be the small with the high sound another be the alto it be big with a low sound next come the tenor it be big yet with an even low sound last but not least be the bass it be the big of them all and the low sounding too the recorder originally come from europe it have be an instrument for over year if you think it be relate to the flute it not,+ screech screech screech ! + the first time we tried to play the recorders it sounded like a lion running his claws down a chalkboard . + in other words we made a + terrible noise ! + see a recorder is an instrument with a very high pitch . + if you dont blow in it correctly it does sound pretty bad . + after + mrs . + romland told us there is a special place for our tongue to be we understood why we sounded so bad . + she said the place was right behind your upper front teeth and then she said once your tongue is there put the recorder up to your mouth and try to say too too too too . + its called tonguing . + then we almost got the right sound .

3,Touch of the flu! Egg in her hair? Poor Ramona! Ramona Quimby  Age 8 is a nine chapter  one hundred and ninety page book about an eight year old girl in third grade. She started school with a surprise gift from her dad  only to have it stolen by a boy she called Yard Ape. One day at lunch she tried to be cool and show off for her friends by cracking an egg on her head and found herself in a big mess. When flu season hit she learned how awful it felt to throw up in class. She and her sister learn about using good manners at the dinner table. As time goes on Ramona and her family solve their problems  and learn to be more caring for each other. They also learn to be more considerate for each other when time alone is needed. My favorite part was during a scene where Ramonas class is at lunch  She took a firm hold on her egg  waited until everyone at her table was watching  and whackâ€”she found herself with a hand full of crumbled shell and something cool and slimy running down her face. (Ramona Quimby  Age 8  Bevery Cleary  p. 60) I thought that was funny because she wanted to be cool like the rest of her class  by breaking a hard boiled egg on her head. But guess what  her mother was in such a hurry she gave Ramona a raw egg! Whoops! I think the one thing the author wants me to know is that when my family may be having problems I can be of help by obeying them and not fussing  disturbing  and/or annoying them. I liked this book because the author chose strong  powerful  descriptive words that made gross  imaginative pictures in my mind. Like in her lunch scene at school  something cool and slimy running down her face  and at her dinner scene at home  One edge of her meat was covered with tiny bumps. Ramona Quimby  Age 8 is one of the best Beverly Cleary books Ive ever read because it pulled me in better than any other book in her series. (I have read 6 of her books.) It made pictures in my mind (Word Choice) and sounded like a real person wrote it (Voice). It also sounded good as I read it  flowed easily from sentence to sentence (Sentence Fluency)  and sounded like a real 8 year old girls life. These traits made me want to keep on reading until the end of the book. I recommend this book to good readers who enjoy good long lasting chapters*. *Max. 25 pages.,touch of the flu egg in her hair poor ramona ramona quimby age be a nine chapter one hundred and ninety page book about an eight year old girl in third grade she start school with a surprise gift from her dad only to have it steal by a boy she call yard ape one day at lunch she try to be cool and show off for her friend by crack an egg on her head and find herself in a big mess when flu season hit she learn how awful it felt to throw up in class she and her sister learn about use good manner at the dinner table a time go on ramona and her family solve their problem and learn to be more care for each other they also learn to be more considerate for each other when time alone be need my favorite part be during a scene where ramona class be at lunch she take a firm hold on her egg wait until everyone at her table be watch and whack she find herself with a hand full of crumble shell and something cool and slimy run down her face ramona quimby age bevery cleary p i think that be funny because she want to be cool like the rest of her class by break a hard boil egg on her head but guess what her mother be in such a hurry she give ramona a raw egg whoop i think the one thing the author want me to know be that when my family may be have problem i can be of help by obey them and not fuss disturb and or annoy them i like this book because the author choose strong powerful descriptive word that make gross imaginative picture in my mind like in her lunch scene at school something cool and slimy run down her face and at her dinner scene at home one edge of her meat be cover with tiny bump ramona quimby age be one of the best beverly cleary book ive ever read because it pull me in good than any other book in her series i have read of her book it make picture in my mind word choice and sound like a real person write it voice it also sound good a i read it flow easily from sentence to sentence sentence fluency and sound like a real year old girls life these trait make me want to keep on reading until the end of the book i recommend this book to good reader who enjoy good long last chapter max page,+ touch of the flu ! + egg in her hair ? + poor + ramona ! + ramona + quimby + age 8 is a nine chapter one hundred and ninety page book about an eight year old girl in third grade . + she started school with a surprise gift from her dad only to have it stolen by a boy she called + yard + ape . + one day at lunch she tried to be cool and show off for her friends by cracking an egg on her head and found herself in a big mess . + when flu season hit she learned how awful it felt to throw up in class . + she and her sister learn about using good manners at the dinner table . + as time goes on + ramona and her family solve their problems and learn to be more caring for each other . + they also learn to be more considerate for each other when time alone is needed . + my favorite part was during a scene where + ramonas class is at lunch + she took a firm hold on her egg waited until everyone at her table was watching and whackshe found herself with a hand full of crumbled shell and something cool and slimy running down her face .

3,Chores are boring! Scrubbing toilets  cleaning sinks  and washing bathtubs take up a lot of my time and are not fun at all. Toilets! When youre scrubbing toilets make sure they are not stinky. Ive scrubbed one before and I was lucky it didnt stink. I think toilets are one of the hardest things to scrub in the bathroom because it is hard to get up around the rim. Sinks are one of the easiest things to clean in the bathroom because they have no rims and they are small. I have cleaned one before and it was pretty easy. Bathtubs  ever washed one? They are big  they are deep  and it is hard to get up around the sides. The bathtub is the hardest  I think  to wash in the bathroom. All chores are boring  especially making my bed. Cleaning my room is OK because I have to organize  and I like organizing. Dusting is the worst: dust  set down  pick up  dust  set down. There are so many things to dust  and its no fun. Chores arent the worst but theyre definitely not the best! ,chore be bore scrub toilet clean sink and wash bathtub take up a lot of my time and be not fun at all toilet when youre scrub toilet make sure they be not stinky ive scrub one before and i be lucky it didnt stink i think toilet be one of the hard thing to scrub in the bathroom because it be hard to get up around the rim sink be one of the easy thing to clean in the bathroom because they have no rim and they be small i have clean one before and it be pretty easy bathtub ever wash one they be big they be deep and it be hard to get up around the side the bathtub be the hard i think to wash in the bathroom all chore be bore especially make my bed clean my room be ok because i have to organize and i like organize dusting be the bad dust set down pick up dust set down there be so many thing to dust and it no fun chores arent the bad but theyre definitely not the best,+ chores are boring ! + scrubbing toilets cleaning sinks and washing bathtubs take up a lot of my time and are not fun at all . + toilets ! + when youre scrubbing toilets make sure they are not stinky . + ive scrubbed one before and I was lucky it didnt stink .

3,I just hate it. I mean really  really  really positively hate  being taken by surprise. Just thinking about it makes me shiver. Boy  Ive been taken by surprise lots of times  lots of ways  by many different people. In my opinion  I think the worst surprise I have been through must have been when I got home from school and expected to see my older brother waiting for me or watching television. But no  my brother wasnt home (at least it seemed like it to me) so  I yelled for my dad outside. No dad. Poor me scared without a brother or father (yeah right) and right when I was walking to my brothers room  boom! Ahhhh! I screamed  my brother jumps out of the closet in the hall. I was really frightened. Ill never forget that  it will scar me for life. After that I figured out my dad was outside somewhere where he could not hear me. I have also been taken by surprise many other times but none of them as worse as The attack of my older brother. It is so annoying when they do it more than once. Example: Laura jumps out of the kitchen and scares Trish and then she leaves. Seconds later Trish passes by the kitchen again  Laura screams Raahh  Trish doesnt scream but is now annoyed. Getting taken by surprise happens most unexpected. I think I will get scared more if you dont make it so fancy  make it original. Example for original: She jumps out screaming Raahh  is original. Example for fancy: He jumps out screaming  Ooga  Booga  along with streamers  confetti etc. That is way too fancy. Me  Trisha Arnold  will give you some advice that I learned: dont take it seriously. It might be scary but  go be free  live along with your life  thats the best cure. Even for The attack of my older brother.   ,i just hate it i mean really really really positively hate be take by surprise just think about it make me shiver boy ive be take by surprise lot of time lot of way by many different people in my opinion i think the bad surprise i have be through must have be when i get home from school and expect to see my old brother wait for me or watch television but no my brother wasnt home at least it seem like it to me so i yell for my dad outside no dad poor me scar without a brother or father yeah right and right when i be walk to my brother room boom ahhhh i scream my brother jump out of the closet in the hall i be really frighten ill never forget that it will scar me for life after that i figure out my dad be outside somewhere where he could not hear me i have also be take by surprise many other time but none of them as worse a the attack of my old brother it be so annoy when they do it more than once example laura jump out of the kitchen and scare trish and then she leave second later trish pass by the kitchen again laura scream raahh trish doesnt scream but be now annoyed get take by surprise happen most unexpected i think i will get scar more if you dont make it so fancy make it original example for original she jump out scream raahh be original example for fancy he jump out scream ooga booga along with streamer confetti etc that be way too fancy me trisha arnold will give you some advice that i learn dont take it seriously it might be scary but go be free live along with your life thats the best cure even for the attack of my old brother,I just hate it .

3,Eyuuuuuuuuu! Nasty! This book was very gross at the beginning because the bullies made a bet with Tom. The bet was for Tom to eat fifteen worms for 50 dollars. What brought me in to the story was the lead which was Hey Tom where were you last night? As I got further into the story it kind of made me want to try a worm â€˜cause in the fifth and sixth chapter it says  The worms were okay. During the eighth and ninth chapter Tom got a very bad stomach ache from all those worms. Tom didnt only lose 50 dollars he lost energy from those worms because when he got the stomach ache he couldnt do anything. How he lost is he missed his worm. When Toms mom learned about the bet she punished him by sending him to his room till dinner. The author included lots of detail. It made really wonderful pictures in my mind from the long and descriptive words that the author used. I think the author wrote this book to tell us not to bet. It is a bad thing to bet because it can hurt your body. I recommend this book for readers who like adventures and interesting stories. ,eyuuuuuuuuu nasty this book be very gross at the beginning because the bully make a bet with tom the bet be for tom to eat fifteen worm for dollar what bring me in to the story be the lead which be hey tom where be you last night a i get far into the story it kind of make me want to try a worm cause in the fifth and sixth chapter it say the worm be okay during the eighth and ninth chapter tom get a very bad stomach ache from all those worm tom didnt only lose dollar he lose energy from those worm because when he get the stomach ache he couldnt do anything how he lose be he miss his worm when tom mom learn about the bet she punish him by send him to his room till dinner the author include lot of detail it make really wonderful picture in my mind from the long and descriptive word that the author use i think the author write this book to tell u not to bet it be a bad thing to bet because it can hurt your body i recommend this book for reader who like adventure and interesting story,+ eyuuuuuuuuu ! + nasty ! + this book was very gross at the beginning because the bullies made a bet with + tom . + the bet was for + tom to eat fifteen worms for 50 dollars . + what brought me in to the story was the lead which was + hey + tom where were you last night ? + as I got further into the story it kind of made me want to try a worm ˜cause in the fifth and sixth chapter it says + the worms were okay . + during the eighth and ninth chapter + tom got a very bad stomach ache from all those worms . + tom didnt only lose 50 dollars he lost energy from those worms because when he got the stomach ache he couldnt do anything . + how he lost is he missed his worm . + when + toms mom learned about the bet she punished him by sending him to his room till dinner . + the author included lots of detail . + it made really wonderful pictures in my mind from the long and descriptive words that the author used .

3,Flying through the air on my bike was a very frightening moment. It was a Wednesday and my family was celebrating my dads birthday. My friend  my cousin Laura  and I decided to go bike riding. I started going faster and faster not knowing what was going to happen. And I flew off my bike. What made me fall off? Maybe my bike tire hit a rock!! Then I noticed I chipped three teeth. Ahhhh!!!! As we were walking back I was bleeding a lot and aching all over. Finally we got home. I got ice on my lip which was swollen. My cousin Jessica called the dentist and we went there right away. Nobody was at the dentists office except for me. He numbed my lip so I could have a good night sleep. After we were done at the dentist we went to the store to get straws for me to sip juice. My dad and I stayed in the car while my mom and my brother went inside. After we went to the store we went home and I went to sleep. The next two days I didnt go to school. From now on I will be more cautious when I ride my bike.,fly through the air on my bike be a very frightening moment it be a wednesday and my family be celebrate my dad birthday my friend my cousin laura and i decide to go bike rid i start go faster and faster not know what be go to happen and i fly off my bike what make me fall off maybe my bike tire hit a rock then i notice i chip three teeth ahhhh a we be walk back i be bleed a lot and ache all over finally we get home i get ice on my lip which be swell my cousin jessica call the dentist and we go there right away nobody be at the dentist office except for me he numb my lip so i could have a good night sleep after we be do at the dentist we go to the store to get straw for me to sip juice my dad and i stay in the car while my mom and my brother go inside after we go to the store we go home and i go to sleep the next two day i didnt go to school from now on i will be more cautious when i ride my bike,+ flying through the air on my bike was a very frightening moment . + it was a + wednesday and my family was celebrating my dads birthday . + my friend my cousin + laura and I decided to go bike riding .

3,These two books are about some greedy people. One is a boy named John Midas  the other is a man named King Midas. John LOVES chocolate. I mean absolutely LOVES chocolate. And the king was filthy rich with gold. Well  one day they each got a taste of there own medicine  because they were so greedy. One day John was going to a friends house  but then for a change he went a different way. Only two blocks along the unfamiliar street  John came to a small corner candy store. (The Chocolate Touch  by Patrick Skene Catling  page 11-12) And thats where his chocolate touch began. Whatever he put into his mouth it turned to chocolate. And the king? Well one day Midas was sitting in his treasure room dreaming about his gold. In his dream he saw a shadow fall across the piles of valuable gold coins  he looked up and saw a stranger standing near him. (King Midas and the Golden Touch  by Judy Rosenbaum  page 2) And thats where his golden touch began. Whatever he touched with his hands  it turned to gold. They liked their touchâ€¦ for a while. Then one day a terrible thing happened! Now you read the rest of the book to find out what the terrible thing was. And when you are done reading this book  you will find out it teaches you a lesson about greediness. By the way  there are some parts you should know about. Like the time John turned his trumpet to chocolate  and the time King Midas turned his food to gold. Both of these books pulled me in with a good lead! The Chocolate Touch started with Most of the time John Midas was a very nice boy. Every now and then  of course  he broke a rule. King Midas and the Golden Touch started out with Once upon a time there was a very rich King named Midas. He lived in a fine castle with his daughter Marygold. I wanted to read the whole book in one day because it got really exciting and interesting with the fun and powerful words the author used. The Chocolate Touch had a little more detail and action than The Golden Touch because the book was longer by 80 pages.  ,these two book be about some greedy people one be a boy name john midas the other be a man name king midas john love chocolate i mean absolutely love chocolate and the king be filthy rich with gold well one day they each get a taste of there own medicine because they be so greedy one day john be go to a friend house but then for a change he go a different way only two block along the unfamiliar street john come to a small corner candy store the chocolate touch by patrick skene catling page and thats where his chocolate touch begin whatever he put into his mouth it turn to chocolate and the king well one day midas be sit in his treasure room dream about his gold in his dream he saw a shadow fall across the pile of valuable gold coin he look up and saw a stranger stand near him king midas and the golden touch by judy rosenbaum page and thats where his golden touch begin whatever he touch with his hand it turn to gold they like their touch for a while then one day a terrible thing happen now you read the rest of the book to find out what the terrible thing be and when you be do reading this book you will find out it teach you a lesson about greediness by the way there be some part you should know about like the time john turn his trumpet to chocolate and the time king midas turn his food to gold both of these book pull me in with a good lead the chocolate touch start with most of the time john midas be a very nice boy every now and then of course he break a rule king midas and the golden touch start out with once upon a time there be a very rich king name midas he live in a fine castle with his daughter marygold i want to read the whole book in one day because it get really exciting and interesting with the fun and powerful word the author use the chocolate touch have a little more detail and action than the golden touch because the book be longer by page,+ these two books are about some greedy people . + one is a boy named + john + midas the other is a man named + king + midas . + john + loves chocolate .

4,Surprise I woke up swiftly. My senses were blurred  except for my hearing. All I could hear was the sound of footsteps stepping on the creaky board in the hallway. I waited for the footsteps to go into the living room. I walked as lightly as I possibly could but no matter how hard I tried  I still made noise. I slipped past my parents room and entered the living room very cautious. I searched the room and found nothing. I went into the kitchen to find three small wrapped presents on the table.

4,I tried to run  but I couldnt. The monster seemed like it was growing by the minute! And then  the most horrible thing was about to happenâ€¦ I screamed and sat bolt upright up in bed. I gasped swallowing huge amounts of air. Id just had the most horrible nightmare ever. Id never been so scared in my life! Still gasping  I called Mom! My mom came sleepily into my bedroom and sat on the edge of my bed. What is it sweetie? she asked  her voice full of concern. Tears swelled up in my eyes as I remembered the ghostly monster from my dream. Iâ€¦ I had a nightmare. I finally managed to say. Poor thing  my Mom said sympathetically as she gave me a hug. But dont worry  she said  you will stop having them when you grow up. I nodded my head in agreement. Although inside I secretly felt that I wouldnt. After my Mom left  I lay on my pillows and started to think. Peopleâ€”mostly grownupsâ€”were always telling me that things would happen  or I would like something better when I was grown up. Apparently they thought being grown up meant liking everything and knowing everything. Well I most certainly did not! Personally I thought growing up meant having responsibility  and trying to make good choices  etc. I wondered if my life would be different as a grown-up. I mean I knew I would be older  and more mature  but would I be prettier? fatter? skinnier? would I choose to get married? or get a job? Then I realized something. I was nine years of age. Right now none of that stuff mattered. I didnt need a husband because I had older siblings! I didnt need a job because my Mom and dad provided for me. The only job I had right now was to be a kid. And that was just what I was going to do. ,i try to run but i couldnt the monster seem like it be grow by the minute and then the most horrible thing be about to happen i scream and sat bolt upright up in bed i gasp swallow huge amount of air id just have the most horrible nightmare ever id never be so scared in my life still gasp i call mom my mom come sleepily into my bedroom and sat on the edge of my bed what be it sweetie she ask her voice full of concern tear swell up in my eye a i remember the ghostly monster from my dream i i have a nightmare i finally manage to say poor thing my mom say sympathetically a she give me a hug but dont worry she say you will stop have them when you grow up i nod my head in agreement although inside i secretly felt that i wouldnt after my mom leave i lay on my pillow and start to think people mostly grownup be always tell me that thing would happen or i would like something well when i be grow up apparently they think be grow up meant like everything and know everything well i most certainly do not personally i think grow up meant have responsibility and try to make good choice etc i wonder if my life would be different a a grown up i mean i know i would be old and more mature but would i be pretty fatter skinnier would i choose to get marry or get a job then i realize something i be nine year of age right now none of that stuff matter i didnt need a husband because i have old sibling i didnt need a job because my mom and dad provide for me the only job i have right now be to be a kid and that be just what i be go to do,I tried to run but I couldnt . + the monster seemed like it was growing by the minute ! + and then the most horrible thing was about to happen I screamed and sat bolt upright up in bed .

4,It was a humid day in July  the Key Bank sign said that it was 85 degrees outside. That day my mom drove me to The Smithfield Theater. I had an important job to do. The job was more of a personal goal. It was to make people laugh. The catch was that if I was to stand up in front of a theater of people and tell a couple of jokes then I would get to see the movie Mission Impossible free. When I got to the theater I was sweating like a pig. The librarian that signed me up was dressed in a clown suit. She said  Are we ready to make people laugh? I feebly answered  Yes... When I got inside the theater a guy was already telling some lame jokes. Then  when everyone was seated he called my name  Cmon down Zachary Williams! As I reached the first step to the stage I had about a hundred butterflies in my stomach. By the third step they multiplied. But then  very abruptly  when I reached for the microphone all of the butterflies disappeared. When I was done telling the jokes I didnt turn red or anything  I just smiled. I noticed the size of the crowd and unexpectedly I knew what I was going to be when I grew up  I knew why God had put me on this green earth  it was because I was going to becomeâ€¦ a comedian.,it be a humid day in july the key bank sign say that it be degree outside that day my mom drive me to the smithfield theater i have an important job to do the job be more of a personal goal it be to make people laugh the catch be that if i be to stand up in front of a theater of people and tell a couple of joke then i would get to see the movie mission impossible free when i get to the theater i be sweat like a pig the librarian that sign me up be dress in a clown suit she say be we ready to make people laugh i feebly answer yes when i get inside the theater a guy be already tell some lame joke then when everyone be seat he call my name cmon down zachary williams a i reach the first step to the stage i have about a hundred butterfly in my stomach by the third step they multiply but then very abruptly when i reach for the microphone all of the butterfly disappear when i be do tell the joke i didnt turn red or anything i just smile i notice the size of the crowd and unexpectedly i know what i be go to be when i grow up i know why god have put me on this green earth it be because i be go to become a comedian,+ it was a humid day in + july the + key + bank sign said that it was 85 degrees outside . + that day my mom drove me to + the + smithfield + theater .

4,Dear Mr. President  Today was probably one of the most important days of your life. The speech you gave was very  very hopeful  sincere  and thoughtful. There are two main issues that I think you should focus on. First  I would like you to work on getting more money to go into schools. I would like to see every school in Washington  and every other state  with enough learning space  tools  and good teachers. I would also like to see the government working for the people instead of the people being servants of the government. The people should not be out there  working their heads off  just so that they can give the government the little amount of hard-earned money they have. The government should be by the people and for the people  instead of by the people and for the politicians. You must have a very hard job and I know you wont be able to do everything by yourself. I hope that you will have plenty of support. I know that you will do your best to do well as President  be able to make good judgements  and make our country into the country that it was meant to be by our founders. My best wishes to you and your extra-hard job.

4,I will always love my grandparents beach house. The way the waves role over the gooey sand  and the way the sand weaves in between your toes. The way we pick up barnacle-covered rocks and watch the sand crabs scurry away  and how we dig for clams and end up knee deep in the never ending sand. Im not the only one to share these pleasures. My aunt  uncle  cousins  family  and of course  my grandparents also share this. In the summer we play volleyball  baseball  and badminton. At my grandparents 4th of July party we go out on the boat called Sea Biscuit. At night we snuggle up in our blankets and toast marshmallows in the campfire while we watch the fireworks explode in the star-filled sky. We have bullhead fishing contests to see who can catch the most bullhead. Then we throw the bullheads back into the salty blue-green ocean. With one final splash they say goodbye to the unfamiliar world. Then they disappear to somewhere known to only the fish and the crabs. We go to a sand bar a couple houses down where we collect sea shells and sand dollars. We fly over the bar  our feet touching every grain of sand  leaving a sign that we were there. Gathering shells and dollars in our pockets  we head back to the place we love with all our hearts. When its time to go  none of us want to leave. As I say my goodbyes  I think of all the fun we had  and what fun we will have next time. ,i will always love my grandparent beach house the way the wave role over the gooey sand and the way the sand weave in between your toe the way we pick up barnacle cover rock and watch the sand crab scurry away and how we dig for clam and end up knee deep in the never end sand im not the only one to share these pleasure my aunt uncle cousin family and of course my grandparent also share this in the summer we play volleyball baseball and badminton at my grandparent th of july party we go out on the boat call sea biscuit at night we snuggle up in our blanket and toast marshmallow in the campfire while we watch the firework explode in the star fill sky we have bullhead fishing contest to see who can catch the most bullhead then we throw the bullhead back into the salty blue green ocean with one final splash they say goodbye to the unfamiliar world then they disappear to somewhere know to only the fish and the crab we go to a sand bar a couple house down where we collect sea shell and sand dollar we fly over the bar our foot touch every grain of sand leave a sign that we be there gather shell and dollar in our pocket we head back to the place we love with all our heart when it time to go none of u want to leave a i say my goodbye i think of all the fun we have and what fun we will have next time,I will always love my grandparents beach house . + the way the waves role over the gooey sand and the way the sand weaves in between your toes . + the way we pick up barnacle - covered rocks and watch the sand crabs scurry away and how we dig for clams and end up knee deep in the never ending sand . + im not the only one to share these pleasures . + my aunt uncle cousins family and of course my grandparents also share this . + in the summer we play volleyball baseball and badminton . + at my grandparents 4th of + july party we go out on the boat called + sea + biscuit . + at night we snuggle up in our blankets and toast marshmallows in the campfire while we watch the fireworks explode in the star - filled sky . + we have bullhead fishing contests to see who can catch the most bullhead . + then we throw the bullheads back into the salty blue - green ocean . + with one final splash they say goodbye to the unfamiliar world . + then they disappear to somewhere known to only the fish and the crabs . + we go to a sand bar a couple houses down where we collect sea shells and sand dollars . + we fly over the bar our feet touching every grain of sand leaving a sign that we were there . + gathering shells and dollars in our pockets we head back to the place we love with all our hearts . + when its time to go none of us want to leave . + as I say my goodbyes I think of all the fun we had and what fun we will have next time . 
4,This is a childs average day in the classroom. The teacher asks a question  the child answers. But children  as we all know  seemingly cannot sit still for long periods of time  and as the average school day lasts for about six hours  they need a break. This is only one of the many reasons that recess was created. Why now take away possibly one of the greatest inventions (besides the wheel) ever to come about? Recess was meant to take the energy out of kids so theyd come back to the classroom ready to learn. If we take away even one recess  children may be too energetic and hyper to even pay attention to the lesson. The art of passing notes will most likely increase and kids may learn even less without recess! Its not just a matter of education  lots of parents agree that children should enjoy their youth while they still can  and live a worry free life before they must face the real world. After all  you have to admit  being cramped up in a desk all day is rather uncomfortable  not to mention boring. So  not only do kids need recess to learn  they need it to maintain their youth. As youve probably heard on the news  lots of kids are complaining about too much homework lately. This is the main reason that some people want to take away recess  to cover the homework during this time. But most schools have a 15 min. recess in the morning and a 30 min. recess in the afternoon. How much more learning can you pack into 45 or 30 min. anyway? Recess isnt enough time for any heavy duty learning  its just enough for kids to get their energy out. So  I come to my conclusion: Kids need their recess!   ,this be a childs average day in the classroom the teacher ask a question the child answer but child a we all know seemingly cannot sit still for long period of time and a the average school day last for about six hour they need a break this be only one of the many reason that recess be create why now take away possibly one of the great invention besides the wheel ever to come about recess be mean to take the energy out of kid so theyd come back to the classroom ready to learn if we take away even one recess child may be too energetic and hyper to even pay attention to the lesson the art of pass note will most likely increase and kid may learn even less without recess it not just a matter of education lot of parent agree that child should enjoy their youth while they still can and live a worry free life before they must face the real world after all you have to admit be cramp up in a desk all day be rather uncomfortable not to mention bore so not only do kid need recess to learn they need it to maintain their youth a youve probably hear on the news lot of kid be complain about too much homework lately this be the main reason that some people want to take away recess to cover the homework during this time but most school have a min recess in the morning and a min recess in the afternoon how much more learning can you pack into or min anyway recess isnt enough time for any heavy duty learn it just enough for kid to get their energy out so i come to my conclusion kid need their recess,+ this is a childs average day in the classroom . + the teacher asks a question the child answers . + but children as we all know seemingly cannot sit still for long periods of time and as the average school day lasts for about six hours they need a break . + this is only one of the many reasons that recess was created . + why now take away possibly one of the greatest inventions ( besides the wheel ) ever to come about ? + recess was meant to take the energy out of kids so theyd come back to the classroom ready to learn . + if we take away even one recess children may be too energetic and hyper to even pay attention to the lesson . + the art of passing notes will most likely increase and kids may learn even less without recess ! + its not just a matter of education lots of parents agree that children should enjoy their youth while they still can and live a worry free life before they must face the real world . + after all you have to admit being cramped up in a desk all day is rather uncomfortable not to mention boring . + so not only do kids need recess to learn they need it to maintain their youth . + as youve probably heard on the news lots of kids are complaining about too much homework lately . + this is the main reason that some people want to take away recess to cover the homework during this time . + but most schools have a 15 min . recess in the morning and a 30 min . recess in the afternoon . + how much more learning can you pack into 45 or 30 min . anyway ? + recess isnt enough time for any heavy duty learning its just enough for kids to get their energy out . + so I come to my conclusion : + kids need their recess ! 
5,I come to you today with some good advice: DONT WALK IN MUD!!! It all started when Melissa and me were walking outside  with umbrellas in hands  rain boots  rain jackets  and no fear from the rain. We were set for anything. At least thats what we thought. But the real truth lay before us! Melissa asked  Can we go into the cow pasture? Sure  I said. Ok  lets go on the count of three  said Melissa. We both said together  One  Two  Three. We both took off like we were being chased by a ghost! We had run to the edge of the barn and came to a halt. There before us was a pasture full of mud! Melissa said  What are you stopping for? I said  MUD! She said  Look just follow me. You wont get stuck  I promise! Before I could say Yes or No  she was off! My heart was pounding. A little voice in my head kept saying  Dont do it  Dont do it  over and over again. Melissa was going deeper and deeper into the cow pasture. She wasnt sinking so why would I? Its just a bunch of dirt  I said to myself. So I took one step  then another and there I was in the middle of the pasture. Actually standing there in mud! Melissa  I said. This isnt so bad. Wait  what am I felling? Thick  cold  gooey  watery  mud! I was sinking as fast as a light bulb burns out. I felt like someone was pushing and pulling me under. My fear was coming true! I started yelling for help. Melissa heard me and came running over to see what my problem was. I told Melissa  The ground is sucking me under! Quick pull me out! She tugged and tugged at my boots  but the mud was winning. We both started screaming for help! To the rescue came my sister Jennie and my cousin Natasha. They grabbed a hold of me and all pulled. Out I popped  but my boots remained. I stepped on my umbrella and then pulled my boots out. My feet were now black and freezing. I put my boots back on and made a mad dash  barely touching the ground  and I was out of the gate! To Melissa I said  Score one for mud and Im out! ,i come to you today with some good advice dont walk in mud it all start when melissa and me be walk outside with umbrellas in hand rain boot rain jacket and no fear from the rain we be set for anything at least thats what we think but the real truth lay before u melissa ask can we go into the cow pasture sure i say ok let go on the count of three say melissa we both say together one two three we both take off like we be be chase by a ghost we have run to the edge of the barn and come to a halt there before u be a pasture full of mud melissa say what be you stop for i say mud she say look just follow me you wont get stick i promise before i could say yes or no she be off my heart be pound a little voice in my head keep say dont do it dont do it over and over again melissa be go deeper and deeper into the cow pasture she wasnt sink so why would i it just a bunch of dirt i say to myself so i take one step then another and there i be in the middle of the pasture actually stand there in mud melissa i say this isnt so bad wait what be i fell thick cold gooey watery mud i be sink as fast a a light bulb burn out i felt like someone be push and pull me under my fear be come true i start yell for help melissa hear me and come run over to see what my problem be i tell melissa the ground be suck me under quick pull me out she tug and tug at my boot but the mud be win we both start scream for help to the rescue come my sister jennie and my cousin natasha they grab a hold of me and all pull out i pop but my boot remain i step on my umbrella and then pull my boot out my foot be now black and freeze i put my boot back on and make a mad dash barely touch the ground and i be out of the gate to melissa i say score one for mud and im out,I come to you today with some good advice : + dont + walk + in + mud ! ! ! + it all started when + melissa and me were walking outside with umbrellas in hands rain boots rain jackets and no fear from the rain . + we were set for anything . + at least thats what we thought . + but the real truth lay before us ! + melissa asked + can we go into the cow pasture ? + sure I said . + ok lets go on the count of three said + melissa . + we both said together + one + two + three . + we both took off like we were being chased by a ghost ! + we had run to the edge of the barn and came to a halt . + there before us was a pasture full of mud ! + melissa said + what are you stopping for ?

5,It all started on a hot sunny day. I didnt think anything was going to happen  but boy was I wrong! Want to go for a bike ride? my friend Lisa asked me. We had just gotten to a really cool camp ground. It had a swimming pool  but the part that I liked the most was the cabins. They were surrounded by tall trees. There was a little trail that I thought would be a perfect place to run away to and have a romantic night with a boy  but enough of that mushy gushy stuff. Sure! I responded as I was already getting my bike and helmet. We wobbled onto the road. We peddled as fast as we could so when we went over pot holes or the turtles  we would bounce off our seat like a bouncey ball. Around the corner  over the bump! Ok here comes the turn. At first it looks like a nice turn  an ordinary turn  but that is exactly what it wants you to think. Here we go! I felt like I was going 100 m.p.h. CRASH! BOOM! BANG! My so called legs or what was left of them were squashed between two unmoving cars. The bony stems that were dangling from the rest of my body were unmovable. OWWWWWW! I screeched  but what I did not know was that five angry people were staring at me. What happened here? probably one of the biggest guys in history said. Im sooo sorry about the car! Well its not my car  and Im glad! The car on the left had a black streak from side to side from my handle bar. The big hairy son of a God (I call him that because he was so big) walked me back to my camp site. Later that eveningâ€¦ Sarah you have to come. YOU crashed into the cars so you WILL come. The horrible words came from my own dads mouth. No! No! No! This isnt happening. I imagined a guy about two times bigger than the first  but to my surprise the humungous person I had imagined was a skinny stick! The skinny stick said that no harm was done. All it needed was a coat of paint. So I guess that I lived happily ever after except that I couldnt walk for the rest of the trip. Maybe that camp ground wasnt so cool after all.   ,it all start on a hot sunny day i didnt think anything be go to happen but boy be i wrong want to go for a bike ride my friend lisa ask me we have just get to a really cool camp ground it have a swimming pool but the part that i like the most be the cabin they be surround by tall tree there be a little trail that i think would be a perfect place to run away to and have a romantic night with a boy but enough of that mushy gushy stuff sure i respond a i be already get my bike and helmet we wobble onto the road we peddle as fast a we could so when we go over pot hole or the turtle we would bounce off our seat like a bouncey ball around the corner over the bump ok here come the turn at first it look like a nice turn an ordinary turn but that be exactly what it want you to think here we go i felt like i be go m p h crash boom bang my so call leg or what be leave of them be squash between two unmoving car the bony stem that be dangle from the rest of my body be unmovable owwwwww i screech but what i do not know be that five angry people be star at me what happen here probably one of the big guy in history say im sooo sorry about the car well it not my car and im glad the car on the left have a black streak from side to side from my handle bar the big hairy son of a god i call him that because he be so big walk me back to my camp site later that even sarah you have to come you crash into the car so you will come the horrible word come from my own dad mouth no no no this isnt happen i imagine a guy about two time big than the first but to my surprise the humungous person i have imagine be a skinny stick the skinny stick say that no harm be do all it need be a coat of paint so i guess that i live happily ever after except that i couldnt walk for the rest of the trip maybe that camp ground wasnt so cool after all,+ it all started on a hot sunny day .

She is ALWAYS nagging me to turn my music down. I somehow have to convince her my loud music should be able to be as loud as I like it. At first I was very weak. Every time I blasted my music  she would come in and tell me to turn it down. I would sadly mope over to the stereo and turn it down  and then apologize. That was when I realized I had to take action or risk some kind of lifetime psychological complex for not being able to stand up to people. Joe! Joe! Turn that music down! I could barely make out those words  but when my mom busted into my room I knew there was going to be trouble. Why dont you ever turn your music down? she yelled. It seems like you are becoming deaf. The less you can hear it  the more you turn it up. Is that right? No  its just that I like the music to be exploding with noise. You cant tell me when you were a kid  you didnt practically blow your speakers out listening to the Beatles or whatever you listened to. Youre right  I cant  she admitted. I had her now  I thought. But still  that doesnt mean you have to blast yours. Well  what do you expect me to listen to? Beethoven? Wellâ€¦ Would that be so bad? Yes! Of course it would. How about I can blast my music while I do my chores? Then you could go outside or something. Well  okay  but if it doesnt work out  you will pay the price in a way that you cant imagine. From that point on my life has been good. Except for the chores. I think my mom got the better end of the deal on that one.   ,what what i cant hear you my music be blare too loudly let me turn it down joe this be the second time ive tell you to turn your music down thats my mom she be always nag me to turn my music down i somehow have to convince her my loud music should be able to be as loud a i like it at first i be very weak every time i blast my music she would come in and tell me to turn it down i would sadly mope over to the stereo and turn it down and then apologize that be when i realize i have to take action or risk some kind of lifetime psychological complex for not be able to stand up to people joe joe turn that music down i could barely make out those word but when my mom bust into my room i know there be go to be trouble why dont you ever turn your music down she yell it seem like you be become deaf the less you can hear it the more you turn it up be that right no it just that i like the music to be explode with noise you cant tell me when you be a kid you didnt practically blow your speaker out listen to the beatles or whatever you listen to youre right i cant she admit i have her now i thought but still that doesnt mean you have to blast yours well what do you expect me to listen to beethoven well would that be so bad yes of course it would how about i can blast my music while i do my chore then you could go outside or something well okay but if it doesnt work out you will pay the price in a way that you cant imagine from that point on my life have be good except for the chore i think my mom get the good end of the deal on that one,+ what ? ! + what ? !

5,I walked into the kitchen and asked What are we having for dinner? Tuna Casserole  she replied. Mom  you know I hate tuna  I said unhappily. Come on John  give it another try. You havent had any tuna fish since last year. OK  Ill give it a little try  I whined. I went and sat down at the dining room table. I picked up my fork and tried to scoop up some tuna. The minute my fork touched the disgusting food  I knew something was wrong. Mom  this stuffs stale! I shouted at her. Let me see the date on the can. My mom brought out the can the tuna came out of. I silently read the date. Eeeewww! I cried out. The date says 2/1/96! Whoops  said my mom. I thought it said 97. Im sorry  she said apologetically. This stuff could have killed me. Chapter 2 â€“ The tuna can lives That night  I woke up hearing voices. Rats  he noticed my date. Couldnt you have â€˜accidentally cut off my date? a voice said angrily. If I did that the mother would have thrown me away  another voice replied. I cant believe it! I thought to myself. The tuna can lives  and the can opener is in it with him! The tuna can spoke again. Lets get him now! Well sneak into his room and you can cut him with your blade! OK! the opener replied. I snuck out my window and went into my garage. I grabbed the sledge hammer and went back into the house. When the tuna can and the can opener opened my door  I ran towards them waving the sledge hammer and screaming Yaa  death to tuna!!! My mom came running into the room to find me smashing the can opener and a tuna can to itty bitty smidgens. What are you doing?! she yelled. Youre grounded! Epilogue I didnt care about getting grounded. What I did care about is destroying tuna. Today I am still against tuna and probably will be for a long time to come.   ,i walk into the kitchen and ask what be we have for dinner tuna casserole she reply mom you know i hate tuna i say unhappily come on john give it another try you havent have any tuna fish since last year ok ill give it a little try i whine i go and sit down at the dining room table i pick up my fork and try to scoop up some tuna the minute my fork touch the disgust food i know something be wrong mom this stuff stale i shout at her let me see the date on the can my mom bring out the can the tuna come out of i silently read the date eeeewww i cry out the date say whoop say my mom i think it say im sorry she say apologetically this stuff could have kill me chapter the tuna can live that night i wake up hearing voice rat he notice my date couldnt you have accidentally cut off my date a voice say angrily if i do that the mother would have throw me away another voice reply i cant believe it i think to myself the tuna can live and the can opener be in it with him the tuna can speak again let get him now well sneak into his room and you can cut him with your blade ok the opener reply i sneak out my window and go into my garage i grab the sledge hammer and go back into the house when the tuna can and the can opener open my door i run towards them wave the sledge hammer and scream yaa death to tuna my mom come run into the room to find me smash the can opener and a tuna can to itty bitty smidgen what be you do she yell youre ground epilogue i didnt care about get ground what i do care about be destroy tuna today i be still against tuna and probably will be for a long time to come,I walked into the kitchen and asked + what are we having for dinner ? + tuna + casserole she replied . + mom you know I hate tuna I said unhappily . + come on + john give it another try . + you havent had any tuna fish since last year . + ok + ill give it a little try I whined .

5,On a dark December night in 1776  as he led a barefoot brigade of ragged revolutionaries across the icy Delaware River  George Washington said  Shift your fat behind  Harry. But slowly or youll swamp the darn boat. He was talking to General Henry Knox (they called him Ox for short). Theres a painting of George Washington where hes standing up in a boat scanning the riverbank for Redcoats. I always thought he just wanted a good view. But I guess the reason he was standing was because he didnt have a place to sit down. Finding a seat in his own boat was hardly the worst of General Washingtons problems. It was cold and wet and icy  and his men were tired and didnt have warm clothes to wear or even enough food to eat. The Revolutionary War was hard on everyone  but it was hard on Washington most of all because he wanted to be home with his wife and children. From 1759  until he was called to fight in 1775  Washington lived with his wife  Martha  and her two children. Washington loved his big farm in Mt. Vernon  Virginia  and although he was one of our countrys most brilliant generals  he was really just a farmer at heart. In a letter he wrote to a friend in England  he said  I can nowhere find such great satisfaction as in working on my plantation. He didnt even want to be President. He said he would feel like a criminal going to his death if he took office. But after everyone voted for him  he felt it was his duty to accept. Washington was our President for the next eight years  but during that time he just wanted to get back home. He would spend weekends there whenever he could  and he made sure he got reports on the condition of his farm. He also liked getting letters from his family. Then  in March of 1797  Washington finally got to go home for good. There were no more wars to fight  and John Adams was going to be President. Washington had been a good President  but he was tired of it. Even his granddaughter noticed how happy he was to be home. In a letter to a friend she wrote  Grandpa is much pleased with being once more Farmer Washington. I always used to think of George Washington as a soldier and a politician  and I guess I always will. But he was really just a farmer. He reminds me a little of Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz. All she wanted to do was get back home. And finally the Wizard told her she could just click her red shoes three times and say Theres no place like home. But George Washington and his men didnt have shoes when they went across the Delaware River. Maybe if they did  history would have turned out completely different.   ,on a dark december night in a he lead a barefoot brigade of ragged revolutionary across the icy delaware river george washington say shift your fat behind harry but slowly or youll swamp the darn boat he be talk to general henry knox they call him ox for short there a painting of george washington where he stand up in a boat scan the riverbank for redcoat i always think he just want a good view but i guess the reason he be stand be because he didnt have a place to sit down find a seat in his own boat be hardly the bad of general washington problem it be cold and wet and icy and his men be tire and didnt have warm clothes to wear or even enough food to eat the revolutionary war be hard on everyone but it be hard on washington most of all because he want to be home with his wife and child from until he be call to fight in washington live with his wife martha and her two child washington love his big farm in mt vernon virginia and although he be one of our country most brilliant general he be really just a farmer at heart in a letter he write to a friend in england he say i can nowhere find such great satisfaction a in work on my plantation he didnt even want to be president he say he would feel like a criminal go to his death if he take office but after everyone vote for him he felt it be his duty to accept washington be our president for the next eight year but during that time he just want to get back home he would spend weekend there whenever he could and he make sure he get report on the condition of his farm he also like get letter from his family then in march of washington finally get to go home for good there be no more war to fight and john adam be go to be president washington have be a good president but he be tire of it even his granddaughter notice how happy he be to be home in a letter to a friend she write grandpa be much pleased with be once more farmer washington i always use to think of george washington a a soldier and a politician and i guess i always will but he be really just a farmer he remind me a little of dorothy from the wizard of oz all she want to do be get back home and finally the wizard tell her she could just click her red shoe three time and say there no place like home but george washington and his men didnt have shoe when they go across the delaware river maybe if they do history would have turn out completely different,+ on a dark + december night in 1776 as he led a barefoot brigade of ragged revolutionaries across the icy + delaware + river + george + washington said + shift your fat behind + harry . + but slowly or youll swamp the darn boat . + he was talking to + general + henry + knox ( they called him + ox for short ) . + theres a painting of + george + washington where hes standing up in a boat scanning the riverbank for + redcoats .

5,The very first time I saw asparagus I hated it. I had never even tried it before  and I still hated it! I tried to pretend like it was not even there and just eat the rest of the meal  but when I was about to get up my dad looked over at my plate and immediately said  No  you may not go â€˜till you have eaten all of that asparagus. I knew right then and there that there was no way out of it. I lifted a minuscule bite to my mouth and tasted it. YUCK!!! Gross! I made a hysterical face and pushed my plate towards the center of the table. There  after a couple of minutes of thinking  an idea suddenly came to me. Slowly  I scraped some of the food into my napkin and put it in my cats food dish. She ate the asparagus and after about half an hour threw up. My mom and dad knew it had been from the asparagus. I got sent to my room. I knew they thought that they were teaching me a lesson  but they werent. I could still hate the look  smell  and taste of asparagus. Chapter Two I must have fallen asleep last night without knowing it because when I woke up it was morning. That is  another boring  rainy  Saturday morning. I could smell the leftovers of breakfast from the kitchen  so I got up and slipped into my robe and slippers and started running up the stairs. Halfway up  I suddenly stopped. What if mom and dad were still mad at me for feeding the cat asparagus? As soon as the word asparagus came into my head a horrible taste filled my mouth. Again I was tasting that gross disgusting taste. I ran up the rest of the way and went into the kitchen and went to the fridge to find something to drink. After drinking half a quart of eggnog I felt much better. I went into my brothers room where he was playing with a football. He looked up when I came in the room. Hi  he said  wanna score some touchdowns? Uh  no  Ive got better things to do with my time. Then I asked him  Wheres mom? How should I know? was his response. I took about fifteen minutes to look for mom and didnt find her. So I got washed and dressed and ate a P.B.J. Then I sat down wondering what on earth to do. A few seconds later my mom came into the room and sat down on the sofa with me and said  Honey  I know you didnt mean to make the cat sick but you should have used your brain! I know  I know  I complained. We had a long conversation. Then after a few minutes mom got up and said  Oh by the way  were having asparagus for lunch! NO!!!  Chapter Three Alex! Lunch is ready! my sister called from the top of the stairs. Coming! I called. Although I wasnt coming. I needed time to think. If they were serving asparagus for lunch they could forget it! I was not eating asparagus again  and that was final! * * * I was sitting at the table with a cold plate of icky asparagus in front of me. It tasted like moldy brains. Everyone else had excused them self ages ago leaving me all alone to finish my disgusting lunch and mourn. I wondered if anyone felt sorry for me. I checked my watch  1:30! Id been at the table for an hour and twenty minutes! I decided there was nothing else left to do but finish up the asparagus. So I got a glass of juice from the fridge and started eating  taking each bite with a gulp of juice afterwards. Finally I was done! I jumped up and started down the stairs to my room. I sat down at my desk and took out a piece of clean stationary and began writing. I was writing to QFC because I knew they had asparagus  I had been shopping there several times. This is what my letter said: Dear Mr. Store Manager  I would like you to throw away all your asparagus. It is causing tragic hazards in my house. If you would like to contact me my address is 1823 Allen Ave. Your asparagus hater  Alex Carter After I was through I folded up the letter  dropped it in an envelope  and put on a stamp. I wanted just to leave it on my desk and give it to the mailman when he delivers  but I just knew that one of my pesky siblings would get into it. So I slipped on a sweatshirt and walked down to the corner mail box and mailed my letter myself. Chapter Four Alex! Alex! ALLEEEXXXX!!! Hmmm? I had been stuck in a great book and hadnt the slightest clue what was going on around me. I put a marker in my book and ran outside where my sister had been calling me. Whats the big idea? Are you trying to make me deaf? I asked with a slight scowl. No  I just wanted you to know mom is going shopping. Oh  is that all? I said with another frown. Hmmph! I stalked back to my book. The book I was reading was called Aliens Invade Vegetable Gardens. Perfect for my problem. I planned to find a solution to the asparagus situation and then naturally I would fix it! Fifteen minutes later I put away my book and went to dinner. As soon as I walked in the dining room I smelled trouble. I looked down at my plate and saw what I smelled! Brussels sprouts! I gave a loud tragic moan and knew this was going to be another story written by Alex Carter. But for now  I would feed my brussels sprouts to the fish.   ,the very first time i saw asparagus i hat it i have never even try it before and i still hat it i try to pretend like it be not even there and just eat the rest of the meal but when i be about to get up my dad look over at my plate and immediately say no you may not go till you have eat all of that asparagus i know right then and there that there be no way out of it i lift a minuscule bite to my mouth and taste it yuck gross i make a hysterical face and push my plate towards the center of the table there after a couple of minute of think an idea suddenly come to me slowly i scrap some of the food into my napkin and put it in my cat food dish she eat the asparagus and after about half an hour throw up my mom and dad know it have be from the asparagus i get send to my room i know they think that they be teach me a lesson but they werent i could still hate the look smell and taste of asparagus chapter two i must have fall asleep last night without know it because when i wake up it be morning that be another boring rainy saturday morning i could smell the leftover of breakfast from the kitchen so i get up and slip into my robe and slipper and start run up the stair halfway up i suddenly stop what if mom and dad be still mad at me for feed the cat asparagus as soon a the word asparagus come into my head a horrible taste fill my mouth again i be taste that gross disgust taste i run up the rest of the way and go into the kitchen and go to the fridge to find something to drink after drink half a quart of eggnog i felt much good i go into my brother room where he be play with a football he look up when i come in the room hi he say wanna score some touchdown uh no ive get well thing to do with my time then i ask him wheres mom how should i know be his response i take about fifteen minute to look for mom and didnt find her so i get washed and dressed and eat a p b j then i sit down wonder what on earth to do a few second later my mom come into the room and sit down on the sofa with me and say honey i know you didnt mean to make the cat sick but you should have use your brain i know i know i complain we have a long conversation then after a few minute mom get up and say oh by the way be have asparagus for lunch no chapter three alex lunch be ready my sister call from the top of the stair come i call although i wasnt come i need time to think if they be serve asparagus for lunch they could forget it i be not eat asparagus again and that be final i be sit at the table with a cold plate of icky asparagus in front of me it taste like moldy brain everyone else have excuse them self age ago leave me all alone to finish my disgust lunch and mourn i wonder if anyone felt sorry for me i check my watch id be at the table for an hour and twenty minute i decide there be nothing else leave to do but finish up the asparagus so i get a glass of juice from the fridge and start eat take each bite with a gulp of juice afterwards finally i be do i jump up and start down the stair to my room i sit down at my desk and take out a piece of clean stationary and begin write i be write to qfc because i know they have asparagus i have be shop there several time this be what my letter say dear mr store manager i would like you to throw away all your asparagus it be cause tragic hazard in my house if you would like to contact me my address be allen ave your asparagus hater alex carter after i be through i fold up the letter drop it in an envelope and put on a stamp i want just to leave it on my desk and give it to the mailman when he deliver but i just know that one of my pesky sibling would get into it so i slip on a sweatshirt and walk down to the corner mail box and mail my letter myself chapter four alex alex alleeexxxx hmmm i have be stick in a great book and hadnt the slight clue what be go on around me i put a marker in my book and ran outside where my sister have be call me whats the big idea be you try to make me deaf i ask with a slight scowl no i just want you to know mom be go shop oh be that all i say with another frown hmmph i stalk back to my book the book i be read be call alien invade vegetable garden perfect for my problem i plan to find a solution to the asparagus situation and then naturally i would fix it fifteen minute later i put away my book and go to dinner as soon a i walk in the dining room i smell trouble i look down at my plate and saw what i smell brussels sprout i give a loud tragic moan and know this be go to be another story write by alex carter but for now i would fee my brussels sprout to the fish,+ the very first time I saw asparagus I hated it .

5,I hate Barbie dolls. The worst things are the commercials. They have annoying little songs that they run in the background while these girls are going Wow! Her braid changes color! and giggling their heads off. I had the little jingle for that dumb Pet Doctor Barbie running in my head for two weeks straight. Why did the song stop then? They came out with a new one! My sister has this weird one where the legs change from that weird orangey-pink skin color to some sort of sparkly black when you put the doll in cold water. When the waters cold  Barbie dives right in; her wet suit magically appears on her skin! Wet suit  shmet suit. I tried spraying the legs of the doll with some cold water  and it looked like either a whole bunch of moles or some weird case of skin cancer. More and more keep coming out  more Dolls of Doom  as I call them. Sure  theyre selling by the thousands. But they only keep them interested for a month  and then they ask for another  and the cycle goes on. Pretty soon  some little girls room will be filled with Barbies. If that happens to my little sister  her room will cave in on mine  which is right under it  unfortunately. When Im old enough  Ill join the Army and get myself an M-1 tank or a fleet of Harriers or something  and raid Mattel.

5,Were moving. Thats what she told him. He couldnt believe it! He had just made the basketball team and was making more friends. What! He exclaimed. Im sorry Jessie  but your Dad got a new job in Oregon. I wish you would stop dragging me around like a doll! he yelled. He ran upstairs and slammed his door. His basketball poster fell down and he kicked it into his closet. He flopped down onto his bed and soon fell asleep. * * * KNOCK  KNOCK! Who is it? Asked Jessie. Its me  said his Mom. Go away  Jessie grumbled. I didnt decide to move to Oregon  your Dads having a hard time  said his Mom. There was a long silence. Good night  Jessie. * * * The sun gleamed through the window shining on Jessie. He went downstairs and poured some cereal into a bowl. He stared at his cereal and let it go soggy. He went back into his room and started to pack up his toys and clothes. His family was poor and he was used to moving. Later  the moving men came in and loaded his furniture into the moving truck. Jessie climbed into his familys tiny white Toyota and slumped onto the back seat. He stared out of his window and silently said goodbye to his old house. He fell asleep holding onto his basketball. Jessie woke up to see the white Toyota turn into a gravel road. After a minute the moving truck turned onto a driveway and a grey and blue two story house stood in front of him. He slowly got out of the car and went inside the new house. He found his room on the second floor and started to unpack his stuff. Later he decided to go look around. He packed a sandwich and went outside. Up the road was some woods. He followed a faint path into the woods where he saw an old shack. Jessie opened the door and something jumped at him. AHHHHHH! yelled Jessie. He tripped on a stone and fell onto his back. He opened up his eyes to see a cat standing on his stomach. It was tan colored with a stripe of white on its forehead. An old collar that said COKIE was strapped onto the cats neck. Cokie got up and ran back into the old shack. Jessie followed Cokie into a room. He leaned against the wall and sighed. All of a sudden the wall made a grinding sound and a whole book stand appeared where a moldy wall had been. He ran to the books and started to read a book called â€˜THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR. A tiny switch was half into the wall. He pushed it and the books disappeared and the moldy wall was back again. He raced back to his house and was half way up the stairs when his Mom asked  Where have you been? Oh  just exploring the woods  Jessie said grinning. * * * He visited the shack many times to read the books. But one day when he was reading a book called ONCE WHEN I LIVED IN SPACE someone said  So you found it. Jessie whirled around to see his Mother walking into the old room. How did you know I was here? demanded Jessie. Before you were born  my grandparents used to come here. They lived up the road. When they were kids they made this place. Grampa was an electricity nerd and he must have built this  she said  marveling at the bookshelf. A single tear slid down her cheek. Then they forgot about it. The library in town is running out of books. We can sell about half of these to the librarian and shell give us enough money to pay the rent and help us buy some new things  said Jessies Mom. Can I keep Cokie? asked Jessie. Sure  said his Mom. I guess moving isnt so bad said his Mom. I guess not  said Jessie grinning. ,be move thats what she tell him he couldnt believe it he have just make the basketball team and be make more friend what he exclaim im sorry jessie but your dad get a new job in oregon i wish you would stop drag me around like a doll he yell he run upstairs and slam his door his basketball poster fell down and he kick it into his closet he flop down onto his bed and soon fell asleep knock knock who be it ask jessie it me say his mom go away jessie grumble i didnt decide to move to oregon your dad have a hard time say his mom there be a long silence good night jessie the sun gleam through the window shin on jessie he go downstairs and pour some cereal into a bowl he star at his cereal and let it go soggy he go back into his room and start to pack up his toy and clothes his family be poor and he be use to move later the move men come in and load his furniture into the move truck jessie climb into his family tiny white toyota and slump onto the back seat he star out of his window and silently say goodbye to his old house he fell asleep hold onto his basketball jessie wake up to see the white toyota turn into a gravel road after a minute the move truck turn onto a driveway and a grey and blue two story house stand in front of him he slowly get out of the car and go inside the new house he find his room on the second floor and start to unpack his stuff later he decide to go look around he pack a sandwich and go outside up the road be some wood he follow a faint path into the wood where he saw an old shack jessie open the door and something jumped at him ahhhhhh yell jessie he trip on a stone and fell onto his back he open up his eye to see a cat stand on his stomach it be tan color with a stripe of white on it forehead an old collar that say cokie be strap onto the cat neck cokie get up and run back into the old shack jessie follow cokie into a room he lean against the wall and sigh all of a sudden the wall make a grinding sound and a whole book stand appear where a moldy wall have be he run to the book and start to read a book call the mysterious visitor a tiny switch be half into the wall he push it and the book disappear and the moldy wall be back again he race back to his house and be half way up the stair when his mom ask where have you be oh just explore the wood jessie say grinning he visit the shack many time to read the book but one day when he be read a book call once when i live in space someone say so you find it jessie whirl around to see his mother walk into the old room how do you know i be here demand jessie before you be bear my grandparent use to come here they live up the road when they be kid they make this place grampa be an electricity nerd and he must have build this she say marvel at the bookshelf a single tear slide down her cheek then they forget about it the library in town be run out of book we can sell about half of these to the librarian and shell give u enough money to pay the rent and help u buy some new thing say jessies mom can i keep cokie ask jessie sure say his mom i guess move isnt so bad say his mom i guess not say jessie grinning,+ were moving . + thats what she told him . + he couldnt believe it ! + he had just made the basketball team and was making more friends . + what ! + he exclaimed . + im sorry + jessie but your + dad got a new job in + oregon .

6,It was a gorgeous morning that first day of fifth grade. With the sun happily peeking over the slight wind  my new dress shone with radiance. My heart was pounding deep inside my chest as I walked into the class. I poked my head nervously through the door and surveyed the chaotic scene that lay before me. Kids were rushing about  kids Id never seen before. I saw her. Anna  with her long blonde hair set back in a headband  her tall athletic frame standing at attention. I could tell right away that she had authority. She was the best  had always been the best  and she knew it. I was intrigued. Nervously  I tiptoed around to the teacher and waited for Anna to notice me. Her cool lips were puckered in a sophisticated pout as she took me in. Her blue-green eyes looked quickly over me with an instant air of disaproval. I could almost hear her commenting. What a baby. A pink sundress? Go back to kindergarten  sweetie. Not a great first impression  as these things go  but as time went by  you could almost feel her disgust rising. The first time I had her over was great. We walked to Hy-Vee and laughed the whole way. Anna always made me laugh. We shared our secrets and I felt myself starting to really enjoy her company. After two or three months  we were actually good friends. If only it would have stayed that way. By sixth grade  we had become best friends. I think it hit us both by surprise because we are totally opposite in every way. Shes blond  tall and lean. A rebel. Im short and dark. Responsible is an understatement. Although we got along well and spent a lot of time together  I always felt inferior around her. It was as if I had to work twice as hard as she did to keep our friendship together. I remember the time my mom took us to the Plaza. We went to the Nature Company. Anna commented on a rock she really liked. I guess she expected my mom to buy it for her  but she didnt. Later I heard her tell another friend that my mom was a cheap Jew. Ill never forget the icy pain and shock  the fear that ran through me at that moment. I ran away and cried.,it be a gorgeous morning that first day of fifth grade with the sun happily peek over the slight wind my new dress shone with radiance my heart be pound deep inside my chest a i walk into the class i poke my head nervously through the door and survey the chaotic scene that lay before me kid be rush about kid id never see before i saw her anna with her long blonde hair set back in a headband her tall athletic frame stand at attention i could tell right away that she have authority she be the best have always be the best and she know it i be intrigue nervously i tiptoe around to the teacher and wait for anna to notice me her cool lip be pucker in a sophisticated pout a she take me in her blue green eye look quickly over me with an instant air of disaproval i could almost hear her comment what a baby a pink sundress go back to kindergarten sweetie not a great first impression a these thing go but a time go by you could almost feel her disgust rise the first time i have her over be great we walk to hy vee and laugh the whole way anna always make me laugh we share our secret and i felt myself start to really enjoy her company after two or three month we be actually good friend if only it would have stay that way by sixth grade we have become best friend i think it hit u both by surprise because we be totally opposite in every way shes blond tall and lean a rebel im short and dark responsible be an understatement although we get along well and spend a lot of time together i always felt inferior around her it be a if i have to work twice as hard a she do to keep our friendship together i remember the time my mom take u to the plaza we go to the nature company anna comment on a rock she really like i guess she expect my mom to buy it for her but she didnt later i hear her tell another friend that my mom be a cheap jew ill never forget the icy pain and shock the fear that run through me at that moment i run away and cry,+ it was a gorgeous morning that first day of fifth grade . + with the sun happily peeking over the slight wind my new dress shone with radiance . + my heart was pounding deep inside my chest as I walked into the class .

6,Our relationship was much like a tranquil volcano. Everything was fine on the outside  but there was always an underlying current of the disaster that was waiting to happen. To the outsider  we were inseparable. What they didnt know was that in three years of friendship  she hadnt invited me over once. I was always the one to do the inviting  the planning. Anna had a best friend before me  but after almost 7 years of friendship  Anna was dumped. I guess inside I was always wondering if Anna really liked me  or if I was just a simple replacement. By seventh grade  things with Anna were very rocky. I had heard from mutual friends that she had been talking about me behind my back. After a while  it seemed the only nice words spoken were when we were face to face. She was too domineering. She always made me feel stupid. In her mind  she was better and I was worse and that was that. One evening at the beginning of our eighth grade year  the tremor hit. Anna spent the night and the whole evening we watched T.V. or read. We didnt talk once. Finally I couldnt stand it anymore. Anna  I said  This is so stupid. We dont talk  we hardly ever do things together anymore  this friendship has been worn out for a long time. Im sorry you feel that way  was her only reply. Five minutes later  Anna had left my home and my life. My whole world seems to be more on track now that shes gone. My self-confidence and my general attitude have improved immensley. I do miss her sometimes. How could I not after three years of friendship? All I can think is that I was a good friend to her. Our relationship didnt survive  but well always have the laughsâ€¦ and the tears.,our relationship be much like a tranquil volcano everything be fine on the outside but there be always an underlying current of the disaster that be wait to happen to the outsider we be inseparable what they didnt know be that in three year of friendship she hadnt invite me over once i be always the one to do the invite the planning anna have a best friend before me but after almost year of friendship anna be dump i guess inside i be always wonder if anna really like me or if i be just a simple replacement by seventh grade thing with anna be very rocky i have hear from mutual friend that she have be talk about me behind my back after a while it seem the only nice word speak be when we be face to face she be too domineer she always make me feel stupid in her mind she be well and i be bad and that be that one evening at the beginning of our eighth grade year the tremor hit anna spend the night and the whole evening we watch t v or read we didnt talk once finally i couldnt stand it anymore anna i say this be so stupid we dont talk we hardly ever do thing together anymore this friendship have be wear out for a long time im sorry you feel that way be her only reply five minute later anna have leave my home and my life my whole world seem to be more on track now that shes go my self confidence and my general attitude have improve immensley i do miss her sometimes how could i not after three year of friendship all i can think be that i be a good friend to her our relationship didnt survive but well always have the laugh and the tear,+ our relationship was much like a tranquil volcano . + everything was fine on the outside but there was always an underlying current of the disaster that was waiting to happen . + to the outsider we were inseparable . + what they didnt know was that in three years of friendship she hadnt invited me over once .

6,Have you ever noticed that someone is always chewing their last stick of gum? For me it has gotten to the point where Im starting to believe that gum is bought one stick at a time. Be assured that if you ask someone for gum their reply will be  Sorry  this is my last piece. A second phase of this strange phenomena is a sudden and inexplicable excess of gum. Every now and then  for no logical reason that I can understand  I will encounter a person who is freely giving out gum. Beware of the stampede call from these people: Anyone want some gum? This question  simply translated  means I have found the mother load of single sticks. Come! Help me chew them. The third and most deadly phase is the need for gum. The symptoms start small and grow without warning. They creep up on the victim with: Does anyone have some gum? Soon the victim realizes that no gum is to be had. He disappears from the playground screaming  I need gum! Please help me! Years later you find him on a street corner begging. He tugs at your coat  Please  can I have a stick of gum? You reply: Sorry  this is my last piece. ,have you ever notice that someone be always chew their last stick of gum for me it have get to the point where im start to believe that gum be buy one stick at a time be assure that if you ask someone for gum their reply will be sorry this be my last piece a second phase of this strange phenomenon be a sudden and inexplicable excess of gum every now and then for no logical reason that i can understand i will encounter a person who be freely give out gum beware of the stampede call from these people anyone want some gum this question simply translate mean i have find the mother load of single stick come help me chew them the third and most deadly phase be the need for gum the symptom start small and grow without warn they creep up on the victim with do anyone have some gum soon the victim realize that no gum be to be have he disappear from the playground screaming i need gum please help me year later you find him on a street corner beg he tug at your coat please can i have a stick of gum you reply sorry this be my last piece,+ have you ever noticed that someone is always chewing their last stick of gum ? + for me it has gotten to the point where + im starting to believe that gum is bought one stick at a time . + be assured that if you ask someone for gum their reply will be + sorry this is my last piece .

6,Company halt! yelled the drill master. My mom stopped and went into position. Her dog tags clinked as she moved. My mom. I would say she was a true hero. At least I think she is. Her life sort of dazzles me. She told me many stories about how she danced in the Nutcracker in front of the King and Queen when she was seven. Now  my mom wasnt born in America. She was born in Denmark. She went to America after she married an American man (my dad). But before she met my dad she had an interesting life. Then again she has an interesting future from that time. Some of these things she make her famous to me. I think that my mom is a true hero from all the things she went through. My mom was able to live through a lot of things when she was in the Danish Army. You see when my mom joined the army it was a very pretigious time. Most of the men laughed at her because she was a woman. But she showed them! She survived many wilderness tests that most of the men couldnt do. She did drills better than anyone! My mom even became the first Danish woman to ride a tank! My mom is in the World Book of records! I think that is really cool! My mom spent four years in the Army then retired. I dont know if she fought in any war  but she made the surviver list! She also got a ton of medals. I am so proud of my mom. Not a lot of women joined the Army when my mom joined. So in one way my mom is a heroine for all women. After my moms encounter with the Army  my mom had a restless life. Three years after mom had retired she met a man named David. They fell in love and a couple months later they got married. You may kiss the bride. Ewww! After the honeymoon my dad had to go Louisiana. He was still in the Marines and he was stationed there. So they moved to the gator state. Nine months later Pop! I came into the world. Really  I came a little early  but Im glad! Who wants to be born on April 15  tax day! Anyway  two years later my dad was restationed to Massachusetts. But another two years later my mom got a diploma at Harvard. There was a big celebration and I ate all of the cake. Burp! Then finally my dad retired from the Marines. He got a lot of medals too. Soon my dad wanted to move again so we moved to Lynnwood and stayed there. Now we live a happy life. Whew! After all this stuff I would pass out! My mom must be very tired! Well  now my mom works with a business that helps people make money. Dad helps her too. Im in the sixth grade doing a writing exam and everything else is okay. My mom used to have a job  but she wanted to be her own boss. I really think my mom is a hero.

6,Oh my God  I exclaimed  Whats John doing out there? Why is he on his hands and knees  Mom? I looked out the big kitchen window  wondering if my eight year old brother was all right. He was on hands and knees in our back yard looking rather distressed. Then he threw up. I ran out to see what happened. John stood up and smiled. I was panicked. You have to come inside now! What happened?! I asked  almost screaming. I ate too much at breakfast. I want to keep playing. Im not sick  Ellie! He pouted at me for the next five minutes until agreeing to come inside with me or  as I threatened  mom would be mad. The minute we got inside he started acting like an angel. Little brat. I thought. I hate him. This typical incident was just yesterday  but I can still remember the morning of March 2nd 1969  a day that has affected my life more than I ever could have suspected. To me  a five year old girl  it seemed pretty simple: Mom was having a baby. I couldnt comprehend the implications this would have on my life. When I woke up that morning I went downstairs to demand breakfast  but  instead  grandma was there  and said bluntly  Your moms at the hospital having the baby. Oh  I thought  completely unaffected. I called my friend  Jakie  who lived across the yard  to come over and play. Jakie was my best friend  and she flipped out wondering about the baby and what was going on. Then I started to get curious about it too. My sister  who had already gone through the birth of a younger sibling (me!)  seemed less than enthusiastic. I started to miss my mom  something that had rarely happened before. When Coral  my mom and Dads closest friend  pulled up in our driveway  everyone told me that we were going to the hospital to see my mom and my new brother. I felt my first pangs of jealousy. We all ran to see my mom  who had been in labor all night. I jumped right into the bed next to my exhausted mother as soon as we got into her room. My brother was being weighed and measured  but we got to hold him soon. I was secretly scared because he was so small and delicate. He looked sort of gross  but everyone else seemed to love him  so I didnt say anything. You could barely see his face because of all the wrinkles. Gross! I thought in disgust! His whole body was covered in wrinkles  and he was on the redish side. We decided to call him John Jordan Strosahl. John (now Johnny-Jordan) grew up to be a superbly cute baby â€” to my disappointment. He had golden blonde baby curls spilling off his head which reminded me of the foam on a coke. Big  round  sapphire eyes lit up his face â€” as if he need it with such a great big  gummy smile. Thats what has bugged me most for all these years. Frankly  John was the cutest baby  and I knew that the amount of doting time we got wasnt equal; this made me pretty mad.,oh my god i exclaim whats john do out there why be he on his hand and knee mom i look out the big kitchen window wonder if my eight year old brother be all right he be on hand and knee in our back yard look rather distressed then he throw up i run out to see what happen john stand up and smile i be panic you have to come inside now what happen i ask almost scream i eat too much at breakfast i want to keep play im not sick ellie he pout at me for the next five minute until agree to come inside with me or a i threaten mom would be mad the minute we get inside he start act like an angel little brat i think i hate him this typical incident be just yesterday but i can still remember the morning of march nd a day that have affect my life more than i ever could have suspect to me a five year old girl it seem pretty simple mom be have a baby i couldnt comprehend the implication this would have on my life when i wake up that morning i go downstairs to demand breakfast but instead grandma be there and say bluntly your mom at the hospital have the baby oh i think completely unaffected i call my friend jakie who live across the yard to come over and play jakie be my best friend and she flip out wonder about the baby and what be go on then i start to get curious about it too my sister who have already go through the birth of a young sibling me seem less than enthusiastic i start to miss my mom something that have rarely happen before when coral my mom and dads close friend pull up in our driveway everyone tell me that we be go to the hospital to see my mom and my new brother i felt my first pang of jealousy we all run to see my mom who have be in labor all night i jump right into the bed next to my exhausted mother as soon a we get into her room my brother be be weigh and measure but we get to hold him soon i be secretly scar because he be so small and delicate he look sort of gross but everyone else seem to love him so i didnt say anything you could barely see his face because of all the wrinkle gross i think in disgust his whole body be cover in wrinkle and he be on the redish side we decide to call him john jordan strosahl john now johnny jordan grow up to be a superbly cute baby to my disappointment he have golden blonde baby curl spill off his head which remind me of the foam on a coke big round sapphire eye light up his face a if he need it with such a great big gummy smile thats what have bug me most for all these year frankly john be the cut baby and i know that the amount of dot time we get wasnt equal this make me pretty mad,+ oh my + god I exclaimed + whats + john doing out there ? + why is he on his hands and knees + mom ?

6,For the next eight years  John dominated all the attention. Every time there was an argument  or even a fight  Mom took Johns side. I had to share a room with A.J.  my older sister  for a while after John was born  and then I had to share a room with the Devil himself. I was not impressed. So what? Yeah  hes extremely cute and only four years old  but he was annoying me!!!!! Who made up the rules about how the youngest gets first priority and who gets to start off in moms bed anyway? In fifth grade  I expressed my resentment in a poem: My brother is on the bed right next to me. Hes singing and playing his new kazoo And making me mad all at the same time. I want him to SHUT UP!!! Hes telling me how much better at things he is than me. Hes putting down his Kazoo. YES! But now hes hitting the cat. I take his kazoo and start hitting him with it. My Mom comes in the room and starts yelling at ME. Jeeze. Through all this I didnt realize how much I loved him. Even being the attention-stealer that he was  he was a good companion  also. We had so much fun goofing off together  and I loved playing airplane with him. This was a game where I put him on my legs and he pretended to be flying. John grew up to be a lot like me which made us extremely compatible  but it was hard because I had to share the limelight. He was very silly and a natural performer  so I felt like there was no more room for my silliness; he took silliness to a whole new level. John and I were frequently sent from the dinner table for being loud  obnoxious  or rowdy. Most times we left the table snickering  and ready to play some more. I was especially good at bullying him and that made me feel better about having to share the limelight. I really enjoyed having a buddy everywhere that I went with the family  even if I wasnt nice to him all the time. I really do love him and always will. He is very entertaining and funny and he has a good heart. Im trying to accept that he didnt mean to dominate the center stage all the time  thats just one of the many lovable assets of his personality. Now  Im looking at John  over the mess on the kitchen table  wondering if hes all right  because hes only eight years old  and that was a lot of throwing up to do. Then he gets to go out and play with his friend  just like he wanted. I feel a little cheated. Would I have gotten to go back out if that was me? I really wish he could have the experience of a younger sibling  just so he would know how I feel.,for the next eight year john dominate all the attention every time there be an argument or even a fight mom take johns side i have to share a room with a j my old sister for a while after john be bear and then i have to share a room with the devil himself i be not impress so what yeah hes extremely cute and only four year old but he be annoy me who make up the rule about how the young get first priority and who get to start off in mom bed anyway in fifth grade i express my resentment in a poem my brother be on the bed right next to me he sing and play his new kazoo and make me mad all at the same time i want him to shut up he tell me how much good at thing he be than me hes put down his kazoo yes but now hes hit the cat i take his kazoo and start hit him with it my mom come in the room and start yell at me jeeze through all this i didnt realize how much i love him even be the attention stealer that he be he be a good companion also we have so much fun goof off together and i love play airplane with him this be a game where i put him on my leg and he pretend to be fly john grow up to be a lot like me which make u extremely compatible but it be hard because i have to share the limelight he be very silly and a natural performer so i felt like there be no more room for my silliness he take silliness to a whole new level john and i be frequently send from the dinner table for be loud obnoxious or rowdy most time we leave the table snickering and ready to play some more i be especially good at bully him and that make me feel well about have to share the limelight i really enjoy have a buddy everywhere that i go with the family even if i wasnt nice to him all the time i really do love him and always will he be very entertaining and funny and he have a good heart im try to accept that he didnt mean to dominate the center stage all the time thats just one of the many lovable asset of his personality now im look at john over the mess on the kitchen table wonder if he all right because he only eight year old and that be a lot of throw up to do then he get to go out and play with his friend just like he want i feel a little cheated would i have get to go back out if that be me i really wish he could have the experience of a young sibling just so he would know how i feel,+ for the next eight years + john dominated all the attention . + every time there was an argument or even a fight + mom took + johns side .

6,Simon Wilken was snacking down on a plum with great gusto. He kept a heavy supply of them in his room. Some of the plums he ate werent finished; they littered the carpet under his king size bed. Simons favorite fruit and vegetables were part of his everyday life. His parents thought good nutrition was important so they owned a fruit & vegetable store and literally stuffed their son until hed burst. When Simon went with his family to their cabin  the pantry back at home came to life. Bananas formed a crude ladder to the floor. Grapes tumbled down to form a cushion. The pineapple almost made a dent in the floor as he came down. Quickly as they fell  the oranges and apples scrambled into a cupboard and came out with scissors. The raisins didnt stay long in that suffocating bag. The brave and gallant colonel mango led the procession into the kitchen while the kiwis defended the rear. Mushroom scouts peered into binoculars from their perches on top of the refrigerator. They noted the movements of the great fruit horde and calculated where they were going. Half of them fell back and reported to the head tomato. Sir  the â€˜orde is moving southeast at a fast march. I reckon theyre goin fer the stairs. Dismissed  came the reply of the tomato. He ordered the carrot to send a couple of radish messengers to the pineapple and ask him what he was doing. The strong radishes scaled the refrigerator with surprising agility and speed. They wanted to make sure the pineapple saw the white flag. A couple of strawberry guards escorted the radishes to the makeshift tent the pineapple was in. Sir  came the voice of a strawberry  three radish messengers to see you. Send â€˜em  the pineapple requested. The radishes were hesitant and stammered but somehow got out their message. E chief toomato want tknow whurr youre goin. Tell him we were going to rescue the casualty plums up in the monsters room. We hate it when plums are half eaten and thrown about. Either no plum should be eaten or all of a plum should be eaten  stated the head fruit. Your master  Chief Tomato  can come with us if he wants. Thankou kindly  zurr  came the grateful reply from the radishes as they climbed quite easily up the piece of lettuce that hung down for them. Soon the whole vegetation mass swarmed the refrigerator to join the fruit horde on their dangerous mission. Greetings were made and as quickly as they met they were off. A dozen onions and peaches rounded the doorway to the stairs. A horrifying shock met them. A huge orange tabby was perched on the stairs snoring loudly. I watched through half closed eyes and kept up the pantomime. This is the introduction.

6,One thing that changed my life forever would have to be the day I went down sand hill. It was summer  and like most summers it was stiflingly humid. It all started about 8:00 A.M. It was hot enough to fry bacon on the sidewalk  not to mention my brain  so I went to ask my mother if I could go down to Church Lake. She didnt see any reason not to go  so she said it was all right. I asked Anthony if he wanted to come with me  and he did. Both of us  in a fit of excitement  raced for our bikes in anticipation of the cool slap of water against our bodies. We had no idea that something really bad was going to happen  so we raced ahead to see who would get there first. He was in the lead  ahead of me about three feet when I noticed that the big hill was approaching. We stopped at the top of the hill and looked down at the curving surface of the road. Excitedly we both took off down the hill  our bodies stiff with adrenaline  and the pure glory of going 40 miles per hour on our bikes. The wind hit our faces with soothing coolness as we raced down the hill  but then I noticed that I was about to crash in to a corner. In a fit of panic I slammed on the brakes  in hopes of escaping the fate of crashing  but the tire locked up  and I started to skid out of control. I fell off my bike and started using my bare leg to stop me from crashing into the ditch  but as most people know  skin  blood  and muscle dont make good brakes. As I was tearing up my leg  my life seemed to flash before my eyes. Bits of memories crammed in between my screams of anguish and pain. When I approached the bottom I stopped sliding. I got up and took a look at my leg. There  where a perfectly good leg had been  was a bloody mess with pieces of road bonded in with muscle tissue. Staring with horror I screamed. A passerby heard me and saw my leg. All the while  Anthony just stared at me like the dolt that he is. The guy that saw me took us home. Now every time I approach a hill I am cautious.,one thing that change my life forever would have to be the day i go down sand hill it be summer and like most summer it be stiflingly humid it all start about a m it be hot enough to fry bacon on the sidewalk not to mention my brain so i go to ask my mother if i could go down to church lake she didnt see any reason not to go so she say it be all right i ask anthony if he want to come with me and he do both of u in a fit of excitement race for our bike in anticipation of the cool slap of water against our body we have no idea that something really bad be go to happen so we race ahead to see who would get there first he be in the lead ahead of me about three foot when i notice that the big hill be approach we stop at the top of the hill and look down at the curve surface of the road excitedly we both take off down the hill our body stiff with adrenaline and the pure glory of go mile per hour on our bike the wind hit our face with soothe coolness a we race down the hill but then i notice that i be about to crash in to a corner in a fit of panic i slam on the brake in hope of escape the fate of crash but the tire lock up and i start to skid out of control i fell off my bike and start use my bare leg to stop me from crash into the ditch but a most people know skin blood and muscle dont make good brake a i be tear up my leg my life seem to flash before my eye bit of memory cram in between my scream of anguish and pain when i approach the bottom i stop slide i get up and take a look at my leg there where a perfectly good leg have be be a bloody mess with piece of road bond in with muscle tissue star with horror i scream a passerby heard me and saw my leg all the while anthony just star at me like the dolt that he be the guy that saw me take u home now every time i approach a hill i be cautious,+ one thing that changed my life forever would have to be the day I went down sand hill . + it was summer and like most summers it was stiflingly humid . + it all started about 8 : 00 A .

6,You all know Bill Gates. When you hear that name you think Billionaire or Lucky  but you havent really looked deep enough. Bill is more than a rich  lucky businessman. He has worked very hard to get where he is today. When he was in college  he thought long and hard about a problem. And then he thought of how to fix it. Bill Gates is an inventor. He did what all inventors do: they think of a problem  and invent a way to make it better or easier. Bill thought of computers  how they didnt do anything that an ordinary person could use them for. So Bill invented software for a computer. All of a sudden  people could make spreadsheets to handle calculations! They could type things just like a typewriter except with perfect erasing tools! But before this happened  work was necessary. Bill and a friend or two spent all of their working (and sometimes sleeping) hours working on turning this dream into reality  and after months of intense work they finally finished with products that helped millions of people worldwide. Being an inventor is great  but to profit from it you must be a good businessman. And Bill Gates is that  also. Not only is he good at business  he is good at marketing and advertising. That is how he was able to get some of the smartest minds in the United States to join his entrepreneurial escapade  Microsoft. That good business mind of Bills soon had his company selling a whole lot of this new software to people around the United States. Still  Bill released breakthrough after breakthrough  introducing Windows  a software program designed to make personal computers even more user friendly. And making billions of dollars didnt stop him. If most people were him  they would probably just leave the company and say  I dont need to deal with this anymore; Im a billionaire! But Bill Gates stays at Microsoft  even being attacked by lawyers  worrying about other competition  and trying to stay ahead. Business is really war. Today he still faces a score of problems. People confronting him in anti-trust lawsuits  and other companies trying hard to pull Microsoft down from its king-of-the-hill position. Many people still think Bill is so lucky and that he has it easy  but he doesnt. Money isnt everything. Bill Gates is my hero because he is a hard worker  and a smart and careful thinker. If I had to choose someone whom I respect a whole lot  it would have to be him. Never giving up  always working on and on  putting up with the criticism. Putting up with the publics opinion of him. Just letting them push him around when he could just say  Thats it. I quit! and leave. Still  he goes through with this every day. And people say he has it easy.

6,Surprised at what he looked like  I found out what love at first sight truly means. I had been wanting a pug since I was four. To my amazement I would get one. As my parents  my friend  Randi  and I drove up the gravel path of my moms old work partner Nancy Degraff  I found out what all my hard work had paid off for. Opening the door of our red car my heart was pounding rapidly. Inside the house I could hear the soft barks of two small girl pugs which were the grandmother  Porcia  and her half sister  Munchy. Hearing the barks of their Jack Russel Terrier  Nancy helped me find out which bark belonged to the pug I would get. Walking up to the door and hearing the soft crackling under my feet  I could see the dark shadows racing about the old house. Come on in  a sweet voice called. As we walked in it felt like one hundred little dogs were zooming around me licking me  rubbing against my legs  and trying to get on my lap. As Nancy cleared away all but the one I wanted  she announced  This is Sherman. As I looked at him my heart melted. Looking at his little smudged in face  and little white spot on his chest  I just about died. His all black fur and the cock of his head made me run over to him and throw my arms around his chubby little body. One thing did stand out about him. He was way bigger than I had ever imagined he would be. Even though he was chunky  I still loved him. I learned that Shermans not like other dogs. Hes got his own way of doing things  and his own way of looking. Thats what makes him special. Yet to my surprise hes the perfect dog in every way.,surprise at what he look like i find out what love at first sight truly mean i have be want a pug since i be four to my amazement i would get one a my parent my friend randi and i drive up the gravel path of my mom old work partner nancy degraff i find out what all my hard work have pay off for open the door of our red car my heart be pound rapidly inside the house i could hear the soft bark of two small girl pug which be the grandmother porcia and her half sister munchy hear the bark of their jack russel terrier nancy help me find out which bark belong to the pug i would get walk up to the door and hear the soft crackling under my foot i could see the dark shadow race about the old house come on in a sweet voice call a we walk in it felt like one hundred little dog be zoom around me lick me rub against my leg and try to get on my lap a nancy clear away all but the one i want she announce this be sherman a i look at him my heart melt look at his little smudge in face and little white spot on his chest i just about die his all black fur and the cock of his head make me run over to him and throw my arm around his chubby little body one thing do stand out about him he be way big than i have ever imagine he would be even though he be chunky i still love him i learn that shermans not like other dog he get his own way of do thing and his own way of look thats what make him special yet to my surprise hes the perfect dog in every way,+ surprised at what he looked like I found out what love at first sight truly means .

6,The deafening crowd was packed into the Kingdome on sold-out Buhner Buzz-Cut Night. Hundreds of people were outfitted in brand new buzz-cuts and were enjoying the Mariner game. And now  Jay Buhner! the announcer blared over the microphone. The friendly  6 foot 3 inch fisherman slowly stepped to the plate. The first pitch was fired over like a bullet from a gun. Jay swings  connects  and belts the ball deep into left field. Its going  going  gone! Goodbye baseball! Another homerun for Jay Buhner! the announcer bellowed  excitement running through his voice. This is why Jay Buhner is my hero. Hes pounded over forty home runs  three years in a row  and has achieved many other amazing feats  too. Jay hit a 479 foot homer at the new Yankee stadium on July 25th 1991  the longest hit in its history. He was the first Mariner to hit for the Cycle (a single  a double  a triple  and a homerun in one game)  on June 23rd  1993 against the Oakland As. In 1996  Jay earned his first Gold Glove award. Last season  at an exhilarating game in Fenway Park  he vaulted over the wall in right field into the bullpen to catch what would have been a colossal home run. Jay Buhner is happily married  and has one son  Gunnar. Issaquah is his pleasant home in the off-season. He drives the best sport-utility vehicle ever made  a rugged Hummer. That is exactly the car Id get if I had all his money. I think that Jay Buhner is a true hero. The Seattle Mariners would be lacking an excellent right fielder without him. I hope he stays in Seattle for the rest of his baseball career.,the deafening crowd be pack into the kingdome on sell out buhner buzz cut night hundred of people be outfit in brand new buzz cut and be enjoy the mariner game and now jay buhner the announcer blare over the microphone the friendly foot inch fisherman slowly step to the plate the first pitch be fire over like a bullet from a gun jay swing connects and belt the ball deep into left field it go go go goodbye baseball another homerun for jay buhner the announcer bellow excitement run through his voice this be why jay buhner be my hero he pound over forty home run three year in a row and have achieve many other amazing feat too jay hit a foot homer at the new yankee stadium on july th the long hit in it history he be the first mariner to hit for the cycle a single a double a triple and a homerun in one game on june rd against the oakland a in jay earn his first gold glove award last season at an exhilarating game in fenway park he vault over the wall in right field into the bullpen to catch what would have be a colossal home run jay buhner be happily marry and have one son gunnar issaquah be his pleasant home in the off season he drive the best sport utility vehicle ever make a rugged hummer that be exactly the car id get if i have all his money i think that jay buhner be a true hero the seattle mariner would be lack an excellent right fielder without him i hope he stay in seattle for the rest of his baseball career,+ the deafening crowd was packed into the + kingdome on sold - out + buhner + buzz - + cut + night . + hundreds of people were outfitted in brand new buzz - cuts and were enjoying the + mariner game . + and now + jay + buhner ! the announcer blared over the microphone . + the friendly 6 foot 3 inch fisherman slowly stepped to the plate . + the first pitch was fired over like a bullet from a gun . + jay swings connects and belts the ball deep into left field . + its going going gone ! + goodbye baseball ! + another homerun for + jay + buhner ! the announcer bellowed excitement running through his voice . + this is why + jay + buhner is my hero . + hes pounded over forty home runs three years in a row and has achieved many other amazing feats too . + jay hit a 479 foot homer at the new + yankee stadium on + july 25th 1991 the longest hit in its history . + he was the first + mariner to hit for the + cycle ( a single a double a triple and a homerun in one game ) on + june 23rd 1993 against the + oakland + as . + in 1996 + jay earned his first + gold + glove award . + last season at an exhilarating game in + fenway + park he vaulted over the wall in right field into the bullpen to catch what would have been a colossal home run . + jay + buhner is happily married and has one son + gunnar . + issaquah is his pleasant home in the off - season . + he drives the best sport - utility vehicle ever made a rugged + hummer . + that is exactly the car + id get if I had all his money .

6,The champagne bubbles up overflowing the crystal wine flutes. Suddenly  the doors to the limo open unfurling a sea of flashing lights. * * * A flash of lightning illuminates the harsh emptiness of the night. In an orphanage children cry mournfully. They are starving. * * * A deep plush  red carpet floods your eyes. Smiles  laughter  cheers bombard the senses. A happiness unknown before now thrives within you. * * * The mud runs thick beneath you in this stench-filled alley. Rain batters your body. With each step your feet plunge into the thick goo. You tug at your feet to relinquish them from the mud and each time you whisper  just one more but you must keep going for the children wait. * * * You feel as though your feet are gliding across the ground. Youre now waiting  the two people on stage say  and now the Oscar for best actor goes toâ€¦ then an ominous silence flushes through the building. The anxiety within you bubbles and churns  as you almost let out a scream of anticipation that just couldnt be held in when your name is announced for the world to hear. You jump into the air and throw your hands up. As you stare blindly out at the crowd all you see are their eyes staring back at you with praise and congratulations. Your whole body is numb with happiness. * * * The door to home is a bombed-out hole in the wall. All you carry with you are two loaves of bread. Inside you are met with a void of darkness. From a corner the flicker of a candle dimly lights the room. 30 children await food. Now all you feel is sadness. * * * These are two different people in two different worlds. One a celebrity  why? Hes seen around the world  mobbed wherever he goes  his every move is the paparazzis life. The other a hero  why? He is selfless. He chose to walk down a different path in life  a path of hardships  poverty  and hunger. Someone doesnt have to be a superhero to be like this. He could be a five-year old giving up his allowance  or a person becoming a mentor  or someones grandma taking in a stray dog. These are the everyday heroes. A celebrity  on the other hand  is famous. Not for some humanitarian act but for acting. Acting is the art of becoming someone you arent. Just because you portray a hero doesnt mean you become one. An actor acts. A hero helps. The actor becomes famous and the hero does not.

6,Right now I want you to pretend you are in a store. As you walk around  you see that some products are much less expensive than others. Now  look at the labels on these cheaper items. You will probably notice that many of these labels say  Made in China  or Made in Honduras. Have you ever stopped to wonder why products made in these countries are so much more affordable than things manufactured right here on American soil? Well  before you buy another inexpensive article of clothing  pair of shoes  sporting good  carpet  or any other product  you might want to think this through. Child labor has long been banned in America  but out of sight should not mean out of mind. Over 200 million children world-wide work full time in conditions not fit for an animal. That means that they do not play sports  they do not attend school  and they do not have fun. These children are prisoners. Take  for example  Pakistan and India. In these countries  a bonded labor system forces child laborers  some as young as four years old  to work for a single employer for many years. They are sometimes literally tied to their loom to ensure they are not slacking off. In return for their servitude  they receive a place to sleep and just enough food to sustain them. In Honduras  13% of the workforce is between 12 and 15 years old. There are no laws restricting the ages of the employees  nor are there any limits on the hours they can work. It is not uncommon for a 13 year old child to put in a 14 hour day with no break. However  Honduran employers are required to have a night school for their young laborers to attend. Children put to work weaving carpets  making soap  or any other number of jobs are never paid in full for their toil. Here in the U.S.  the minimum wage is over five dollars an hour. In countries that hire minors to do the dirty work there is almost never a minimum pay requirement. In Haiti  children are  on average  paid 28 cents per hour. In Sri Lanka  the median is 18 cents. Vietnamese and Chinese children should not expect their wages to exceed 11 cents. These numbers are truly tragic. Before you buy something made in a country that condones the labor of young children who work for pennies just so that you can have a more inexpensive item  please think about the situation you are contributing to.,right now i want you to pretend you be in a store a you walk around you see that some product be much less expensive than others now look at the label on these cheap item you will probably notice that many of these label say make in china or make in honduras have you ever stop to wonder why product make in these country be so much more affordable than thing manufacture right here on american soil well before you buy another inexpensive article of clothe pair of shoe sport good carpet or any other product you might want to think this through child labor have long be ban in america but out of sight should not mean out of mind over million child world wide work full time in condition not fit for an animal that mean that they do not play sport they do not attend school and they do not have fun these child be prisoner take for example pakistan and india in these country a bond labor system force child laborer some as young a four year old to work for a single employer for many year they be sometimes literally tie to their loom to ensure they be not slack off in return for their servitude they receive a place to sleep and just enough food to sustain them in honduras of the workforce be between and year old there be no law restrict the age of the employee nor be there any limit on the hour they can work it be not uncommon for a year old child to put in a hour day with no break however honduran employer be require to have a night school for their young laborer to attend child put to work weave carpet make soap or any other number of job be never pay in full for their toil here in the u s the minimum wage be over five dollar an hour in country that hire minor to do the dirty work there be almost never a minimum pay requirement in haiti child be on average pay cent per hour in sri lanka the median be cent vietnamese and chinese child should not expect their wage to exceed cent these number be truly tragic before you buy something make in a country that condone the labor of young child who work for penny just so that you can have a more inexpensive item please think about the situation you be contribute to,+ right now I want you to pretend you are in a store . + as you walk around you see that some products are much less expensive than others . + now look at the labels on these cheaper items . + you will probably notice that many of these labels say + made in + china or + made in + honduras . + have you ever stopped to wonder why products made in these countries are so much more affordable than things manufactured right here on + american soil ? + well before you buy another inexpensive article of clothing pair of shoes sporting good carpet or any other product you might want to think this through . + child labor has long been banned in + america but out of sight should not mean out of mind . + over 200 million children world - wide work full time in conditions not fit for an animal . + that means that they do not play sports they do not attend school and they do not have fun . + these children are prisoners . + take for example + pakistan and + india . + in these countries a bonded labor system forces child laborers some as young as four years old to work for a single employer for many years . + they are sometimes literally tied to their loom to ensure they are not slacking off . + in return for their servitude they receive a place to sleep and just enough food to sustain them . + in + honduras 13 % of the workforce is between 12 and 15 years old . + there are no laws restricting the ages of the employees nor are there any limits on the hours they can work . + it is not uncommon for a 13 year old child to put in a 14 hour day with no break . + however + honduran employers are required to have a night school for their young laborers to attend . + children put to work weaving carpets making soap or any other number of jobs are never paid in full for their toil . + here in the U .

6,Walking home from my bus stop is often an adventure. I never know when I am going to encounter a big dog  an angry neighbor  or perhaps even a killer tree. It was a beautiful day. The sky was blue with only a few lacy clouds  the air was cool and fresh. Crisp leaves were crackling beneath my feet. It would have been a wonderful day to walk slowly  enjoying the weather. Unfortunately  I had forgotten my coat and the otherwise nice weather was chilling me to the bone. To make matters worse  my back was hurting from a ligament I pulled during soccer practice earlier in the week. So despite the pleasant surroundings  I was feeling rather miserable. Then my mind began to wander  as it often does. I began to think of my science class where we were studying the brain and had just discussed the idea of hypnosis helping with minor pain. I also remembered that hypnosis and meditation were similar. Thinking of this reminded of a talk Id once had with my step-dad about meditation. I put these thoughts together and came up with my great idea for the day: to relieve my suffering from the cold and my back pain  I would meditate while walking home. Being the whimsical person I am  I decided that I would try this idea  disregarding the protests of the saner  more logical voice in my head. To begin with  I concentrated on warmth. I thought of fires  of warm houses  of summertime. I slowed my breathing to promote a more relaxed state. It was all going rather well  I was actually feeling warmer and my back wasnt bothering me as much. I smiled. Then I realized my nose hurt. A few seconds later I figured out the cause: I had run into a tree. Not just any tree  but a big rough-barked tree. I immediately jumped away  hopping in a circle  yelping with pain. Next I sat down and felt my nose to make sure it wasnt flattened (it wasnt). To show the tree my rage  I kicked it  resulting in a hurt foot. I glared at it menacingly  figuring that it couldnt hurt me any more if I just looked at it. Im sure the big dogs and angry neighbors were all getting a good laugh by now.

I never know when I am going to encounter a big dog an angry neighbor or perhaps even a killer tree . + it was a beautiful day . + the sky was blue with only a few lacy clouds the air was cool and fresh . + crisp leaves were crackling beneath my feet . + it would have been a wonderful day to walk slowly enjoying the weather . + unfortunately I had forgotten my coat and the otherwise nice weather was chilling me to the bone . + to make matters worse my back was hurting from a ligament I pulled during soccer practice earlier in the week . + so despite the pleasant surroundings I was feeling rather miserable . + then my mind began to wander as it often does . I began to think of my science class where we were studying the brain and had just discussed the idea of hypnosis helping with minor pain . I also remembered that hypnosis and meditation were similar . + thinking of this reminded of a talk + id once had with my step - dad about meditation . I put these thoughts together and came up with my great idea for the day : to relieve my suffering from the cold and my back pain I would meditate while walking home . + being the whimsical person I am I decided that I would try this idea disregarding the protests of the saner more logical voice in my head . + to begin with I concentrated on warmth . I thought of fires of warm houses of summertime . I slowed my breathing to promote a more relaxed state . + it was all going rather well I was actually feeling warmer and my back wasnt bothering me as much . I smiled . + then I realized my nose hurt . A few seconds later I figured out the cause : I had run into a tree . + not just any tree but a big rough - barked tree . I immediately jumped away hopping in a circle yelping with pain . + next I sat down and felt my nose to make sure it wasnt flattened ( it wasnt ) . + to show the tree my rage I kicked it resulting in a hurt foot .

6,my name is Randy the Rill. You may not have heard that word before  so heres a little background. A rill is a very small stream. Some rills are the kind that just drain an area when it rains. That is important  so there wont be floods. My sister  Rhonda the Rill  is of this type. But  aaahh  back to me. Im pretty important  too  ya know. I drain a small pond just east of Wilkeson. If I wasnt here  hed just burst. Besides keeping that guy in business  I also support a variety of animal life. There is a family of deer that lives on the ridge above me that consists of a mom and two fawns. I occasionally see the father around also. But every morning  those two cuties come down to one of my larger pools to drink. Boy  that really tickles! At least they dont wade through me. I also support a healthy population of cutthroat and resident steelhead. There is a population of caddis and mayflies that also hatch here. The fish I mentioned earlier do a good job of keeping them under control. In turn  the fish are the first choice of the raccoon family (you should see the little tikes try to catch those cutthroat). Some other animals that I support are salamanders  toads  frogs  snakes  rabbits  and squirrels. I also support many plant varieties. The ferns do a good job of keeping my waters cool  and the old spruce log that fell built a pool with a nice cascading waterfall that does a good job aerating my waters  along with the other waterfalls I own. The pool I just mentioned is deep  with a pebbly bottom  and crystal clear water. The wide selection of moss and lichen does a good job of keeping the soil around me from eroding away. The lush forest around me is perhaps the prettiest in the world. The wild blue huckleberry around me is in full strength. On a warm sunny day  I can smell the light fragrance of them. In the lower reaches of me  I meander through a little dell  lush with tiny grand fir only 2 ft. high  huckleberry  and wandering strawberry. The bright green club moss is in abundance here  carpeting the fertile topsoil. Here and there a little red newt pauses in its courting  and when alarmed  scurries for the shelter of a nearby nursery log  where wild mushrooms sprout up like groups of little elf umbrellas. Under a nearby fir  a small mouse pauses in its search for food  where rattlesnake plantain produces perfect cover. In the open  where the sun has penetrated the old growth spruce  wild mint and clover create a sweet smelling perfume. Another plant Ill mention is â€” My gosh  is that thunder I hear? That pond is in for a beating now! Well  no time to talk! I have a pond to drain.

6,I cant remember the first time I climbed that tree  or even any time that I wasnt able to. It was a mulberry tree  growing between my house and the Smiths house. Actually  it was a little closer to theirs. It wasnt always the center of our play â€” we played other games like hide and seek  baseball  tag  leaf fights  we had mulberry feasts â€” but it was always there. Ty  the oldest  would climb up close to the top  then Lisa  second  then Tanner  who is actually the youngest  and finally me  content on the first or second branch. I remember jumping contests and strange pulley-like contraptions to haul mulberries  and some autumn days when we just collected the leaves and made beds out of them with blankets we had snuck from the house. We would convince ourselves that we could spend the night out there in our leaf beds  but it never happened. About once a year  Mr. Smith would get some idea that he wanted to cut down the tree  and every year  we would all scream and gasp  No! You cant! One year  he even managed to get out his chainsaw and walk up to it before we all ran out  me from my house  Lisa and Tanner and Ty from theirs  yelling and screaming and standing in front of it. I dont think he ever would have actually cut it down  but he wouldnt give up without an argument from all of us. I think he let us win and brought it up the next year just to see what we would do. Another game  I guess. Growing up the way I did  I will always think that my childhood was the best that anyone could ever have. I went to kindergarten and elementary school and middle school in Camden  but I grew up in Lagrange  with Lisa and Tanner and the tree  in my house on the river. I am not nearly an adult now  but I have already grown up. It will never be like that again. It will never be like anything more than once  so the only thing to do is enjoy every moment of life  no matter what  because in the next minute  it will change and you will be on to a new part. Everything is a memory  and while I sit here reminiscing over what was then  I know Ill be reminiscing again in just a few years over what I am doing right now. My father says that the day a thirteen year old is nostalgic  he will fly around the world. Well  Dad  you better start your trip.

6,The explosions and gunshots were definitely getting worse. Not only was the enemy advancing  the scatterfire was starting to take a toll on the men. Lieutenant Jim Osborne was running out of options. He ordered the tanks to take out enemy clusters and to destroy the missile trucks coming this way. He then ordered an airstrike of the surrounding area  hoping to finish this soon. He called a general retreat  took out some troops coming from behind a dune  and then retreated himself. He could already hear the roar of the F-16 coming this way. 20 minutes later it was over  but the scene would forever etch itself into Jims mind. 19 troops dead  and more than 80% of the rest injured. The U.S. would pay dearly for this. In 1990  most of America knew when we routed Iraqs army. How we got away almost unscathed. Almost. My Uncle  Lieutenant Jim Osbornes unit  the Falcons  was once one of the best fighting units in the Marines. They would infiltrate enemy missile silos  destroy chemical plants  and otherwise make themselves a thorn in the lions paw. But it all changed during the Gulf War. Their mission was Top Secret: my Uncle still cannot tell me what he did  but they infiltrated Iraqs eastern borders on November 29th  1989. They stayed hidden for about 6 weeks  not seeing anyone until the enemy just sort of showed up. They ambushed the Falcons and basically slaughtered them. It was horrible  a black mark on Americas military record. After that  the Falcons who survived were disbanded  and everyone was sent home. When my Uncle came home  you could see the shadows beneath his eyes  a haunted  frightening face looked upon you as you gazed back up at him. He had taken a bullet in his arm  which was slinged  and a deep scratch etched itself in his face  and he looked old and warn. I was 5Â½ at the time  and  not understanding what had just happened to my Uncle  I ran to him  and asked him what happened to his arm. He told me he got hurt  but that he would stay home now. My family came up behind me with tears in their eyes  and they hugged him  and told him they loved him. He stayed at my house for about a year after that  trying to get enough to buy a house of his own. When I was older  he told me what really happened. His troop had come out of some foothills when approximately 300 Iraqi soldiers ambushed them. Jims troops were slaughtered  and Jim himself was lucky to make it out alive. He would have flashbacks every once in a while afterwards  too. It would be horrible to watch him  it was like someone watching a horror movie without anyone else seeing it. Six years after Jim got back  he got married to Susan Patchler  a woman who knew one of his troops in the Gulf War. They bought a house together  and I think their son just turned 3. Jim had gotten his life together in just six years after being psychologically unfit to live on his own. And thats why I admire Jim so much. In the Gulf War he was a brave leader. Afterwards  he had the courage to live with his skeletons over and over again. He got his life back. I dont know if I would have the courage to do that. Jim is so strong  it makes my mother cry every time we talk about it. I fashion my life after my uncle  even though I doubt I would be staying as strong as he. I secretly wish I was. Because someone who works from his lowest point up to a life filled with family and friends is someone who is richer than Bill Gates by far! He earned his life  and loves it dearly. He would risk everything if he could save it. I salute you  Lieutenant Jim Osborne.

9,Ive never understood why so many of my friends were in such a hurry to grow up. When I look around at the adults I know  growing up doesnt seem like much fun. My parents always seem worried about things. If its not me or my brother  its the house or the car or work  or something having to do with one of their parents. And other adults dont seem much happier either. My friends parents seem to have just as many problems to deal with. Whenever I visit after school  the moms look tired  and you can forget about even talking to the dads for a couple of hours after they get home from work  if they even get home at all. (In fact  I dont think Ive ever met the fathers of some of my friends. Its as though they dont even exist.) Im not saying that every adult I know is like this. Its just that most adults never seem to really be able to enjoy anything without worrying about it  too. No matter what Im doing with my parents  they always seem bothered by the thought that something bad might happen  or that they might be doing something wrong. Sometimes things do go wrong  but mostly things turn out OK. Nothing really bad has ever happened in our family  but my parents always seem nervous about things  or unsure of themselves  as though they dont really know what theyre doing. From my point of view  being an adult doesnt look so good. Get up  go to work  come home  go to sleep  try to get the kids to do whatever it is you want them to do. And on the weekends maybe you get up a little later  but its basically the same thing: work around the house  take care of the kids  etc. Who wants to do that? I look at everything my parents have to do and I wonder whats the point? Is this really what I have to look forward to? I guess its hard being an adult. When youre an adult  youre in the middle  and theres no one to help you out on either end. Youve got kids and parents to take care of  and nobody around to take care of you. I guess the hardest part for me in imagining what life will be like when I grow up is looking at all the adults I know now  and not seeing anyone who seems really happy. I dont know a single adult who likes their job: my mom and dad dont  my friends parents dont  and I dont think my teachers do either. All I ever hear from adults are complaints. And even though I know most parents really love their children  they dont seem to show it very much  and so I wonder if having children is really as terrific as everyone says it is. Everybodys always talking about adults being good role models for kids  but maybe kids should be models for them. Maybe we could teach them a few things about how to have a good time and enjoy life. Its worth a try. Id hate to think that the way growing up seems to me now is the way its going to be when I get there.,ive never understood why so many of my friend be in such a hurry to grow up when i look around at the adult i know grow up doesnt seem like much fun my parent always seem worried about thing if it not me or my brother it the house or the car or work or something have to do with one of their parent and other adult dont seem much happy either my friend parent seem to have just a many problem to deal with whenever i visit after school the mom look tired and you can forget about even talk to the dad for a couple of hour after they get home from work if they even get home at all in fact i dont think ive ever meet the father of some of my friend it a though they dont even exist im not say that every adult i know be like this it just that most adult never seem to really be able to enjoy anything without worry about it too no matter what im do with my parent they always seem bother by the thought that something bad might happen or that they might be do something wrong sometimes thing do go wrong but mostly thing turn out ok nothing really bad have ever happen in our family but my parent always seem nervous about thing or unsure of themselves a though they dont really know what theyre do from my point of view be an adult doesnt look so good get up go to work come home go to sleep try to get the kid to do whatever it be you want them to do and on the weekend maybe you get up a little later but it basically the same thing work around the house take care of the kid etc who want to do that i look at everything my parent have to do and i wonder whats the point be this really what i have to look forward to i guess it hard be an adult when youre an adult youre in the middle and theres no one to help you out on either end youve get kid and parent to take care of and nobody around to take care of you i guess the hard part for me in imagine what life will be like when i grow up be look at all the adult i know now and not see anyone who seem really happy i dont know a single adult who like their job my mom and dad dont my friend parent dont and i dont think my teacher do either all i ever hear from adult be complaint and even though i know most parent really love their child they dont seem to show it very much and so i wonder if have child be really as terrific a everyone say it be everybodys always talk about adult be good role model for kid but maybe kid should be model for them maybe we could teach them a few thing about how to have a good time and enjoy life it worth a try id hate to think that the way grow up seem to me now be the way it go to be when i get there,+ ive never understood why so many of my friends were in such a hurry to grow up . + when I look around at the adults I know growing up doesnt seem like much fun . + my parents always seem worried about things . + if its not me or my brother its the house or the car or work or something having to do with one of their parents . + and other adults dont seem much happier either . + my friends parents seem to have just as many problems to deal with . + whenever I visit after school the moms look tired and you can forget about even talking to the dads for a couple of hours after they get home from work if they even get home at all .

9,He was great  a one-of-a-kind guy. Stand-up  Church-going  humble  butt-kicking kind-of guy  that John Lytle  Lytle with a â€˜y  thank you very much. John Lytle  my brother  blood -brother that is. I knew him through fourth and fifth-grade  when we lived in Gresham. He was a friend of a friend  and when we met  we just hit it off. We were best friends. We knew each other for only three months before we started acting like wed known each other all our lives. Three months into the fourth-grade before we decided wed wanted to be blood-brothers  and were going to do it pretty much like the Indians had. So  we set it for the next Friday night  when I was staying the night at his house. Friday approached  and finally arrived. At 11:45 pm  when all was quiet and his parents were asleep  we crept out to the hollow in the woods  just in back of Johns house. With us  we took two candles  a small  stainless steel pen-knife  two large bottles of root-beer  and a small book of matches. We packed all of this in a small blanket. At 11:55 pm.  we arrived at the hollow  and began setting up. We laid the blanket down and put the candles down into the moist dirt at both ends. At 11:58 pm.  we started. First we did sort of a chant we wrote. It read: I (Mark  John) do solemnly swear  body and soul  to defend my blood-brother and help him in time of need  and to keep him clean and good. We read this at the same time  and  when finished  shook right hands while putting the left one on each others shoulder. We then lit the candles. After that  we got on our knees in the middle of the blanket. First John used the pen-knife  then I. We both made a small incision in the middle finer of our right hands. A moment later  at midnight  we pressed our incisioned fingers together and let the blood flow into the other. At a minute past midnight  we were brothers. We took out the root-beer and toasted each other and our newfound brotherhood. After that it seemed we had a mind link. We knew when the other was angry and didnt wish to converse with anyone. But again we knew when the other needed someone to talk to  if they were depressed or whatever. But we always just automatically knew when we saw each other. We never had to say a thing. We knew when we were around each other too much  when we needed a week or two with our other friends. Because of this  this way we realized we needed time off from one another  I think we were better friends than most. However  aside from being blood-brothers and American  we really didnt have that much in common. He liked the Beatles  I liked Hall & Oates. And while he was darker in skin and hair color  and a little shorter  too  I was sort of fair haired and light-skinned  and a little taller than he is. From our friendship  I know now what they mean by opposites attract. John was the best kid I ever knew. There when I need him  gone when he knew I needed to be alone. And I feel darn privileged of having the extreme honor of being his blood-brother. I just wish we could have carted him along when we moved here to Canby. God bless his soul.

9,In my old  battered black wallet I carry many things. A letter from a friend. My lunch ticket. My social security card. Many other tidbits and items as well. There is one thing however  which I prize above all my possessions. It is a photograph. Its small  and the photographer was not good. That does not matter. What matters is the person in the photograph. His name is Bill Stevenson. We first met almost two years ago  when I moved to Vancouver. It was my first day and the school was the largest I had ever been to. I was nervous. I walked into my first class slightly late. I took a seat. Looking around  I noticed several people staring at me. I dont like to be stared at  so I was uncomfortable. Since it was the first day of junior high  the teacher took it easy on us. We played a game of what is called Trivial Pursuit. The room was divided in half for teams. The person behind me  a muscular blond guy  made polite conversation. When a question came to him  he answered it correctly. Guess how I knew that? he challenged. I confessed I didnt know. We have the game at home  he said grinning widely. Ive had that question before. So  that little picture is my prized possession. It reminds me of my best friend and his family. Whenever I see it  I think of Bill. And then I laugh. Bill Stevenson  your quite a friend.,in my old battered black wallet i carry many thing a letter from a friend my lunch ticket my social security card many other tidbit and item as well there be one thing however which i prize above all my possession it be a photograph it small and the photographer be not good that do not matter what matter be the person in the photograph his name be bill stevenson we first meet almost two year ago when i move to vancouver it be my first day and the school be the large i have ever be to i be nervous i walk into my first class slightly late i take a seat look around i notice several people star at me i dont like to be star at so i be uncomfortable since it be the first day of junior high the teacher take it easy on u we play a game of what be call trivial pursuit the room be divide in half for team the person behind me a muscular blond guy make polite conversation when a question come to him he answer it correctly guess how i know that he challenge i confess i didnt know we have the game at home he say grin widely ive have that question before so that little picture be my prized possession it remind me of my best friend and his family whenever i see it i think of bill and then i laugh bill stevenson your quite a friend,+ in my old battered black wallet I carry many things .

9,As I step out of the pick-up it hits me  the smell of manure drifting down from the barn. A sliding glass door swishes open  and clomping down the ramp is my boss  Robert Taylor. Put your lunch in the van  Steve. Ill be there in a minute. I turn and walk toward the van  an old 69 green and white Dodge Sportsman  covered with an inch of dust. When I open the door and peer in  it reminds me of a walk-in trash can. The floor lies out of sight underneath a sea of garbage. I kick some garbage out of my way and hop up in the seat. Before long  here comes Rob  clomping across the driveway. He opens the door  groans as he gets up into his seat  cranks the motor over  and the motor sputters to a start  filling the air inside the van with the smell of burnt oil. My first impression is that we wont make it out of the driveway  but we sputter out onto the road  and head toward town. When we pull into the circular drive  I peer through the dust-smudged window to find that the tractor is still there. On the side it reads Massey-Ferguson  but with Robert  its hard telling what it really is. As I sit down in the seat I adjust the hunk of foam rubber to a comfortable position. Once I have accomplished this  I sit down and start cranking on the prehistoric starter. Slowly  and then more rapidly  like a steam engine building up speed  the black smoke rolls out of the pipe functioning as a muffler and away we go.,a i step out of the pick up it hit me the smell of manure drift down from the barn a slide glass door swish open and clomp down the ramp be my bos robert taylor put your lunch in the van steve ill be there in a minute i turn and walk toward the van an old green and white dodge sportsman cover with an inch of dust when i open the door and peer in it remind me of a walk in trash can the floor lie out of sight underneath a sea of garbage i kick some garbage out of my way and hop up in the seat before long here come rob clomp across the driveway he open the door groan a he get up into his seat crank the motor over and the motor sputter to a start fill the air inside the van with the smell of burnt oil my first impression be that we wont make it out of the driveway but we sputter out onto the road and head toward town when we pull into the circular drive i peer through the dust smudge window to find that the tractor be still there on the side it read massey ferguson but with robert it hard tell what it really be a i sit down in the seat i adjust the hunk of foam rubber to a comfortable position once i have accomplish this i sit down and start crank on the prehistoric starter slowly and then more rapidly like a steam engine build up speed the black smoke roll out of the pipe functioning a a muffler and away we go,+ as I step out of the pick - up it hits me the smell of manure drifting down from the barn .

9,I walk up the hill with my friends  then turn into our cul-de-sac  go to the front door  put the key in the lock  turn  and step in. The house breathes a kind of spooky hello as I set my books down and go to the kitchen where the inevitable note is waiting: Have a snack. Be home soon. I love you. As Im munching cookies  I think how Id like to go out and shoot a few hoops if I had someone to do it with. You can play Nintendo by yourself  but it isnt the same. So I forget that for now. I should be doing my Spanish homework anyway. Too bad I dont have an older brother or sister to help conjugate all those dumb verbs. I could call a friend  sure  but if I had a brother or sister  Id have a built-in friend. While Im feeling so sorry for myself  I hear my friends Denise and Kevin across the street. Shes screaming bloody murder because he is throwing leaves in her hair and threatening to put a beetle in her backpack. She has just stepped on his new Nikes. I do not have these squabbles. I guess the big advantage  if you call it that  to being an only child is that my life is my own  nobody borrows my CDs or my books or my clothes. I also get a bigger allowance than I probably would if I had siblings. My parents take me everywhere  from the mall to the East Coast. Maybe they wouldnt if they had other kids. (On the other hand  it would be more fun going if I had someone my own age.) All these great advantages are overshadowed by one big disadvantage  though  and its the main reason I would change things if I could. When you are an only child  your parents depend on you to be the big success all the time. You are their big hope  so you cannot fail. You have to be good at sports  popular  and have good grades. You need a career goal. You have to have neat hair and clothes that look pressed. You have to have good grammar  clean socks  good breath  and table manners. If youve ever felt jealous of somebody who is an only child  dont. Its a lot of pressure. I often wish for a little screw-up brother or sister my parents could worry about for a while. So  while having a neat room with nothing disturbed is great  Id take a brother or sister in a minute if I could. The big irony is  if I had that mythical brother or sister  I would probably be wishing myself an only child again the first time my baseball shirt didnt come back or my stereo got broken. Life is like that.

9,An Education Lasts a Lifetime Education is a key element in developing the skills necessary for a successful life. Too often students are more involved earning a paycheck than spending time on their academic studies. Students need to realize that their high school classes will prepare them for a brighter future. A high school students time is very limited. Homework and extra curricular activities are time consuming and if a student adds a job into this busy schedule  less time is devoted to their academic studies. The effects of this could be receiving lower grades or not taking challenging courses. A job would also limit the amount of time a teenager has for social activities and sports  thereby causing a withdrawal from friends and the high school community. The job environment is not always beneficial to the student. In most cases the wages are low and the hours are long. Sometimes employers can be very demanding and schedules are not flexible. The skills being used may not be beneficial in furthering their career  and they might become comfortable with the paycheck and not strive to reach their full potential. Money is the root of many problems associated with teenagers. A paycheck gives a student the power to purchase many commodities including cars  clothing and electronics. They may also be exposed to drugs and alcohol. Students are being introduced to a new environment and the challenge of managing their money comes into play. Teenagers already have enough pressures and stress in their lives and they may find it difficult to juggle academics along with their work schedule. High school is a time of growth both mentally and physically. Students should focus their attention on their studies so they can one day achieve their dreams.,an education last a lifetime education be a key element in develop the skill necessary for a successful life too often student be more involved earn a paycheck than spending time on their academic study student need to realize that their high school class will prepare them for a brighter future a high school student time be very limited homework and extra curricular activity be time consuming and if a student add a job into this busy schedule less time be devote to their academic study the effect of this could be receive low grade or not take challenge course a job would also limit the amount of time a teenager have for social activity and sport thereby cause a withdrawal from friend and the high school community the job environment be not always beneficial to the student in most case the wage be low and the hour be long sometimes employer can be very demand and schedule be not flexible the skill be use may not be beneficial in further their career and they might become comfortable with the paycheck and not strive to reach their full potential money be the root of many problem associate with teenager a paycheck give a student the power to purchase many commodity include car clothing and electronics they may also be expose to drug and alcohol student be be introduce to a new environment and the challenge of manage their money come into play teenager already have enough pressure and stress in their life and they may find it difficult to juggle academic along with their work schedule high school be a time of growth both mentally and physically student should focus their attention on their study so they can one day achieve their dream,+ an + education + lasts a + lifetime + education is a key element in developing the skills necessary for a successful life . + too often students are more involved earning a paycheck than spending time on their academic studies . + students need to realize that their high school classes will prepare them for a brighter future .

9,The smell of old  dusty books reminds me of my father. An avid collector  he had many books  most of which went unread. He owned books on everything from medicine to Vietnam to several sets of encyclopedias. When I enter one of his haunts  such as Powells  I am carried back to a time when the two of us were happy. I see him standing by a shelf  thumbing through a medical journal  or opening his wallet to pay for yet another purchase  knowing full well that Mom would lecture him on wasting money on books you never read anyways! Strolling past rows and rows of books  I remember how  after the cancer struck  he came less and less and read fewer and fewer books. They became just part of the scenery  collecting only dust and memories. Near the end  perhaps knowing he would never get to read them all  he gave almost all of the books away  keeping only a few and treating them with an almost holy reverence  as if any crease or mar would destroy them totally.

9,"The sweat on your brow. A layer of dust on your face. Out in the woods. Somewhere. And on a horse. Of all the places in the world  I feel best on a horse. Listening to the clip-clop of the hooves. Swatting at flies. (Which probably doesnt sound appealing to most people but  when youre on a horse  everythings enjoyable  even swatting flies!) Not everyone likes being around horses  which is hard for me to understand. Some people are deathly afraid of them. The girl Im going to tell you about is one of those people. Two years ago  I went on a four-hour ride  my longest yet. I remember it distinctly. We were at Simpson Stables  just at the edge of the Mt. Henderson wilderness area. Only one other person would go on the ride besides the trail guide. Her name was Jennifer. I think she was 11 or 12 years old and I doubt she had ever been on a horse in her life. At first I thought she must be a pretty good rider because she had great boots and she was  after all  on the four-hour ride. I was soon proven wrong. I mounted Pal  my mighty  beautiful  smart horse  with no problem. Jennifer  on the other hand  didnt have any luck. With the help of two trail hands  the red-faced girl finally got her foot in the stirrup. Then  with one last might heave  the dazed Jennifer struggled the rest of the way onto her weak  ugly  dumb-as-a-doornail horse  Van. The name explains him completely. (Just think of an old  beige  Volkswagen van.) As soon as Jennifer got on her beige Volkswagen  her proud rancher-type grandpa and not-so-rancher-type grandma came to take a picture. She managed a faint smile. Then Van shook his head and snorted  and Jennifer grew pale and grabbed the saddle horn tight. After that  I realized that the only reason shed agreed to the trail ride was to please rancher-gramps. As we headed away from the gate  the sun felt warm on our backs. Birds flew everywhere. Jennifer  however  wasnt enjoying any of this. Getting on was only the beginning of her troubles. Whenever we loped the horses  Jennifer would hold Van in check  screaming at the top of her lungs for him to slow down. No wonder we didnt see any deer. Half an hour after setting out on the trail  I lost faith in the trail guide  too. He took out a round container from his back pocket  opened the lid and pulled out a wad of tobacco. After a minute or so  a long stream of tobacco juice shot from his mouth  gumming up the nearby grass and trees. And as if that wasnt enough  he pulled out a pack of cigarettes and lit up â€” in the middle of a dry  drought-stricken forest! There went all my faith in the only other normal person on the ride  blowing away like his cigarette ashes. I thought he must be insane. I was sure the whole forest would go up in flames. Fortunately  he knew enough not to put it out in the middle of the pine needles. In spite of everything  I enjoyed myself  listening to the horses hooves and the squeak of the leather saddle  rocking to the rhythm of Pals smooth gait. Someday  Im going on the ideal trail ride. This is how it would be. My family and I would set out on our own horses for a three or four-day ride near Henderson or someplace with hardly any people. There wouldnt be any smoking  silly trail guides  and no Jennifer. Just the family  the horses  and the wildlife. I think Will Rogers was right when he said there was nothing as good for the inside of a person as the outside of a horse.""",the sweat on your brow a layer of dust on your face out in the wood somewhere and on a horse of all the place in the world i feel best on a horse listening to the clip clop of the hoof swat at fly which probably doesnt sound appeal to most people but when youre on a horse everythings enjoyable even swat fly not everyone like be around horse which be hard for me to understand some people be deathly afraid of them the girl im go to tell you about be one of those people two year ago i go on a four hour ride my long yet i remember it distinctly we be at simpson stable just at the edge of the mt henderson wilderness area only one other person would go on the ride besides the trail guide her name be jennifer i think she be or year old and i doubt she have ever be on a horse in her life at first i think she must be a pretty good rider because she have great boot and she be after all on the four hour ride i be soon proven wrong i mount pal my mighty beautiful smart horse with no problem jennifer on the other hand didnt have any luck with the help of two trail hand the red face girl finally get her foot in the stirrup then with one last might heave the dazed jennifer struggle the rest of the way onto her weak ugly dumb a a doornail horse van the name explain him completely just think of an old beige volkswagen van as soon a jennifer get on her beige volkswagen her proud rancher type grandpa and not so rancher type grandma come to take a picture she manage a faint smile then van shake his head and snort and jennifer grow pale and grab the saddle horn tight after that i realize that the only reason shed agree to the trail ride be to please rancher gramps a we head away from the gate the sun felt warm on our back bird fly everywhere jennifer however wasnt enjoy any of this get on be only the beginning of her trouble whenever we lop the horse jennifer would hold van in check screaming at the top of her lung for him to slow down no wonder we didnt see any deer half an hour after set out on the trail i lose faith in the trail guide too he take out a round container from his back pocket open the lid and pull out a wad of tobacco after a minute or so a long stream of tobacco juice shot from his mouth gum up the nearby grass and tree and a if that wasnt enough he pull out a pack of cigarette and light up in the middle of a dry drought stricken forest there go all my faith in the only other normal person on the ride blow away like his cigarette ash i think he must be insane i be sure the whole forest would go up in flame fortunately he know enough not to put it out in the middle of the pine needle in spite of everything i enjoy myself listen to the horse hoof and the squeak of the leather saddle rock to the rhythm of pal smooth gait someday im go on the ideal trail ride this be how it would be my family and i would set out on our own horse for a three or four day ride near henderson or someplace with hardly any people there wouldnt be any smoking silly trail guide and no jennifer just the family the horse and the wildlife i think will rogers be right when he say there be nothing as good for the inside of a person a the outside of a horse,"+ the sweat on your brow .

9,There is an old hill on my Grandmas property. The hill is grown over with grass  dead stinging nettles  and skunk cabbage. There is an old rickety bridge that you have to jump off to get safely to the ground because blackberries block the way. After the bridge you have to walk through matted dead grass  then you get to an old cedar tree. You cut through the small trail around the cedar tree to get to the road-like flat slanty path to the field. You sneak through the long dead grass. Finally you reach the fence. Be careful not to let the big white dog see you looking at the horses. (He thinks he owns and is guard of the fence and all things on both sides of it.) For a better view  go to the funny shaped tree  it works as a good lookout  and its a safe place where the neighbor dogs cant get you. (No matter how hard they jump.) From the tree you can see a lot â€” my Uncles horses (down the hill) the Kapowsin and the Shady Ridge creeks  the place where the creeks meet together  the trail (both of them)  the two bridges  the neighbors houses  Mr. Ls cows  and all the other trees and fields. When youre done looking around (and when the coast is clear of the big white dog) you can jump down and head for the one still usable trail that my mom made and used when she was little. Im not sure how its possible that the trail is still there but I think the coyotes  deer  possum  skunk  rabbits  mice  and snakes use it  and keep it there. Be careful when you go down because if youre behind someone pesky  pushed aside branches will slap you in the face. When you get to the waterside  sit down  listen tot he rushing  slurping  sound of water  the lapping against the sandy bank  the birds chirping  watch for animals. If you stay still and quiet the animals will relax and come out of hiding  and the birds will start chirping. Walk back to the big cedar tree and wander eastward  up the busy hill and you will find yourself in the cemetary. If you dont want to go there  go west and take a swim in the icy water. (If you dont freeze.) When youre really cold  dry off. If you want  catch a couple of crawdads. Then  go home and fry your crawdads  and eat them  and think about your day on the hill.   ,there be an old hill on my grandma property the hill be grow over with grass dead stinging nettle and skunk cabbage there be an old rickety bridge that you have to jump off to get safely to the ground because blackberry block the way after the bridge you have to walk through mat dead grass then you get to an old cedar tree you cut through the small trail around the cedar tree to get to the road like flat slanty path to the field you sneak through the long dead grass finally you reach the fence be careful not to let the big white dog see you look at the horse he think he own and be guard of the fence and all thing on both side of it for a good view go to the funny shape tree it work a a good lookout and it a safe place where the neighbor dog cant get you no matter how hard they jump from the tree you can see a lot my uncles horse down the hill the kapowsin and the shady ridge creeks the place where the creek meet together the trail both of them the two bridge the neighbor house mr ls cow and all the other tree and field when youre do look around and when the coast be clear of the big white dog you can jump down and head for the one still usable trail that my mom make and use when she be little im not sure how it possible that the trail be still there but i think the coyote deer possum skunk rabbit mouse and snake use it and keep it there be careful when you go down because if youre behind someone pesky push aside branch will slap you in the face when you get to the waterside sit down listen tot he rush slurp sound of water the lapping against the sandy bank the bird chirp watch for animal if you stay still and quiet the animal will relax and come out of hiding and the bird will start chirp walk back to the big cedar tree and wander eastward up the busy hill and you will find yourself in the cemetary if you dont want to go there go west and take a swim in the icy water if you dont freeze when youre really cold dry off if you want catch a couple of crawdad then go home and fry your crawdad and eat them and think about your day on the hill,+ there is an old hill on my + grandmas property . + the hill is grown over with grass dead stinging nettles and skunk cabbage . + there is an old rickety bridge that you have to jump off to get safely to the ground because blackberries block the way . + after the bridge you have to walk through matted dead grass then you get to an old cedar tree . + you cut through the small trail around the cedar tree to get to the road - like flat slanty path to the field . + you sneak through the long dead grass . + finally you reach the fence . + be careful not to let the big white dog see you looking at the horses .

9,I remember walking through shopping centers while my mom looked for shoes. I always wished I would grow another inch or two so my feet could fit into the wonderful big persons shoes. My mother would look over several kinds  then  after choosing her favorite  ask the clerk for the left shoe. I longed for the day when I could try them on  just like she did. Being able to wear shoes with heels represented a grown-up to me. I wanted to be an adult in the worst way. Sometimes after we had gone shopping  I would sneak into my mothers bedroom. Then quietly  so no one would hear  I would slip the new shoes out of their box and onto my feet. What I used to think was a grand and ladylike gait  was really an unsteady wobble. I would saunter over to the full length mirror to admire my shoes â€” well  her shoes. Then I would twirl around and cast condescending glances at the closet  nightstand  lamp and other furniture. I would pretend these things were some of the other fourth graders in my class at school. One Saturday afternoon  I was destined to spend the day at a shoe store in town. Sitting in the back seat  I started to think about fancy shoes. Upon arriving  I discovered large signs that advertised a sale at the shoe store. Grudgingly I dragged in. After a few minutes  I noticed something. My mom  who wears a size 8Â½ was looking in the size 5Â½ section. Suddenly  I straightened up and looked at her again. Yes  she was there! I couldnt believe it  maybe she was looking for shoes for me. Megan  said my mother Would you come over here for a moment? Immediately I leaped to my feet  and in a flash I was by my mothers side. In her hand was a shoe  the most beautiful that I had ever seen. It was black patent leather with a dazzling red bow on the toe. Honey  would you try this on? she said. Immediately I said yes. The shoe fit perfectly. It was made for me. I looked pleadingly into her eyes for the sparkle that meant I could have them. Then she said  Clerk  would you please get the mate for me? I just couldnt believe it! I was the luckiest girl in the whole fourth grade! When we got home  I tried on the shoes with my best dress. Then I went into the kitchen and twirled around so my father could see. I didnt know what he would say. I stood and bit my lip waiting for the inevitable to come. To my surprise he said that I was turning into a pretty young lady! I will remember that moment forever. A year or so later I grew out of the shoes. I regretfully packed them in a box to give away. A girl who lived next door was to get my shoes. A few months later I was at a school carnival and saw the girl wearing my shoes. They were a size too big and they flopped around. Even so  I could see the glow on her face. She was wearing big persons shoes. ,i remember walk through shopping center while my mom look for shoe i always wish i would grow another inch or two so my foot could fit into the wonderful big person shoe my mother would look over several kind then after choose her favorite ask the clerk for the left shoe i long for the day when i could try them on just like she do be able to wear shoe with heel represent a grow up to me i want to be an adult in the bad way sometimes after we have go shopping i would sneak into my mother bedroom then quietly so no one would hear i would slip the new shoe out of their box and onto my foot what i use to think be a grand and ladylike gait be really an unsteady wobble i would saunter over to the full length mirror to admire my shoe well her shoe then i would twirl around and cast condescending glance at the closet nightstand lamp and other furniture i would pretend these thing be some of the other fourth grader in my class at school one saturday afternoon i be destine to spend the day at a shoe store in town sit in the back seat i start to think about fancy shoe upon arrive i discover large sign that advertise a sale at the shoe store grudgingly i drag in after a few minute i notice something my mom who wear a size be look in the size section suddenly i straighten up and look at her again yes she be there i couldnt believe it maybe she be look for shoe for me megan say my mother would you come over here for a moment immediately i leap to my foot and in a flash i be by my mother side in her hand be a shoe the most beautiful that i have ever see it be black patent leather with a dazzling red bow on the toe honey would you try this on she say immediately i say yes the shoe fit perfectly it be make for me i look pleadingly into her eye for the sparkle that meant i could have them then she say clerk would you please get the mate for me i just couldnt believe it i be the lucky girl in the whole fourth grade when we get home i try on the shoe with my best dress then i go into the kitchen and twirl around so my father could see i didnt know what he would say i stood and bite my lip wait for the inevitable to come to my surprise he say that i be turn into a pretty young lady i will remember that moment forever a year or so later i grow out of the shoe i regretfully pack them in a box to give away a girl who live next door be to get my shoe a few month later i be at a school carnival and saw the girl wear my shoe they be a size too big and they flop around even so i could see the glow on her face she be wear big person shoe,I remember walking through shopping centers while my mom looked for shoes .

9,Thoughts pound in my head  day after day  until I get them down on paper. Each idea brings out a slice of whats inside of me. That may mean hours of writing fiercely  while thoughts flip through my head and new ideas emerge. Other times it means crumbling up pages of crossouts  or retyping one page over and over until Im satisfied with how it reads. Then there are times that are maddening; I cant go forward or backward  instead I stare at a blank page for hours. Still I write. I cant imagine how I could stop. Writing is power. I control my writing. Its as stable as I am. No one can change it  except for me. I make all the decisions. Other people give me advice  but Im the one who puts the words on the paper. As a writer  I am free. No one tells me what I can and cant say. I have to decide what part of me should be written  how much of me I want to share. There are no rules or boundary lines to follow. Some things arent meant to be written  but the only way to learn what they are is by writing them. Writing isnt all facts. The facts are what can be taught  but the rest comes only from the writer. Teachers can give us guidelines  advice  and encouragement that well treasure  but the heart of a piece comes from us. Writing is more than following rules and advice; it requires that the writer follow her heart. Writing expands me. It stimulates my mind. When I write  I feel alive  I want to know everything. Im always acquiring new skills. Soon after I started writing I needed more answers than I could get from my English book or from my parents. I started learning by studying how other people wrote  and then picked up on my own mistakes. I pored over every bit of information I could find. A lot of the time I improved subconsciously  absorbing new vocabulary and techniques from all around me. My writing is always changing. Sometimes Im half way through a page  and Ill just rewrite it completely. What I find interesting about writing is that I can see myself growing along with it. It makes me look at the world through different perspectives  and helps me understand myself. My writing gradually grows. I spend hours trying to capture the core of myself within the empty pages of my journal. Over time  my writing becomes more structured as I carefully choose every word that I use to make them fly right off the page into my readers minds. Writing is my companion. Its what I do in my spare time. On rainy summer days  while my mother works  my father is outside  and my sister is at a friends house  I write. I pour out my deepest secrets  my strongest feelings. This is what I do. This is why I write. ,thought pound in my head day after day until i get them down on paper each idea bring out a slice of whats inside of me that may mean hour of write fiercely while thought flip through my head and new idea emerge other time it mean crumble up page of crossouts or retyping one page over and over until im satisfy with how it read then there be time that be madden i cant go forward or backward instead i stare at a blank page for hour still i write i cant imagine how i could stop writing be power i control my write it as stable a i be no one can change it except for me i make all the decision other people give me advice but im the one who put the word on the paper a a writer i be free no one tell me what i can and cant say i have to decide what part of me should be write how much of me i want to share there be no rule or boundary line to follow some thing arent meant to be write but the only way to learn what they be be by write them write isnt all facts the fact be what can be teach but the rest come only from the writer teacher can give u guideline advice and encouragement that well treasure but the heart of a piece come from u write be more than follow rule and advice it require that the writer follow her heart write expands me it stimulate my mind when i write i feel alive i want to know everything im always acquire new skill soon after i start write i need more answer than i could get from my english book or from my parent i start learn by study how other people write and then pick up on my own mistake i pore over every bit of information i could find a lot of the time i improve subconsciously absorb new vocabulary and technique from all around me my writing be always change sometimes im half way through a page and ill just rewrite it completely what i find interest about writing be that i can see myself grow along with it it make me look at the world through different perspective and help me understand myself my write gradually grow i spend hour try to capture the core of myself within the empty page of my journal over time my write becomes more structured a i carefully choose every word that i use to make them fly right off the page into my reader mind write be my companion it what i do in my spare time on rainy summer day while my mother work my father be outside and my sister be at a friend house i write i pour out my deep secret my strong feeling this be what i do this be why i write,+ thoughts pound in my head day after day until I get them down on paper . + each idea brings out a slice of whats inside of me . + that may mean hours of writing fiercely while thoughts flip through my head and new ideas emerge . + other times it means crumbling up pages of crossouts or retyping one page over and over until + im satisfied with how it reads . + then there are times that are maddening ; I cant go forward or backward instead I stare at a blank page for hours . + still I write .

9,In yesteryear  when Moby Dick was just a tadpole  and the seas rolled and thundered over the jetties and onto the shore  I searched for my first sand dollar still hidden somewhere in the ever stretching Naragansett Beach. Id been going there since I was a toddler  not finding much more than sea weed and empty crab shells  which were picked clean by the screeching sea gulls  natures best garbage man. Now I was five  I could run and search on my own  no more holding hands with Mom and Dad. I could run with the big kids down the beach with the wind roaring in my ears like huge jet engines. I was in search of the still fashionable sand dollar  that naturally perfect disc with a dotted star on top and a hole in the center of its flat bottom. While in town the first evening of beachcombing  I spotted just the box I wanted for my collection of valuables. It was not just a box  but a red cedar chest approximately 4 by 8 inches and designed like a treasure chest. Mom and Dad thought it was just what I needed. I couldnt wait for morning to come. I could hear the waves beckoning to me through the partially open window in my room. Like counting sheep  the waves took their toll. Clam digging started early before light  my parents went while the tide was still out. I looked for shells. I found all different kinds: broken crabs  empty clams because the sea gulls got to them first  but still no sand dollars. After lunch  Mom and Dad decided to help me find some sand dollars  but first  Dad said he had to stop at a store in town to get some things for dinner. He left me to go ahead and look for sand dollars with Mom. When Dad got back he helped me look  too. I was looking up and down  around rocks and in tide pools. Then I spotted it  partially sticking out of the sand; I found it  my first sand dollar! It was probably the only one on the beach for 50 miles. I put it in my treasure box. This shell still sits in my box along with years of awards  pins  buttons from athletics and scouting  and a Swiss army knife I found in the woods where I used to live. These things keep a warm link to my past. Naragansett Beach  I found out years later  doesnt have sand dollars  but the local souvenir shop does  kept in reserve for moms and dads who want to help their children build a memory.   ,in yesteryear when moby dick be just a tadpole and the sea roll and thunder over the jetty and onto the shore i search for my first sand dollar still hide somewhere in the ever stretch naragansett beach id be go there since i be a toddler not find much more than sea weed and empty crab shell which be pick clean by the screech sea gull natures best garbage man now i be five i could run and search on my own no more holding hand with mom and dad i could run with the big kid down the beach with the wind roaring in my ear like huge jet engine i be in search of the still fashionable sand dollar that naturally perfect disc with a dotted star on top and a hole in the center of it flat bottom while in town the first evening of beachcombing i spot just the box i want for my collection of valuable it be not just a box but a red cedar chest approximately by inch and design like a treasure chest mom and dad think it be just what i need i couldnt wait for morning to come i could hear the wave beckon to me through the partially open window in my room like count sheep the wave take their toll clam digging start early before light my parent go while the tide be still out i look for shell i find all different kind broken crab empty clam because the sea gull get to them first but still no sand dollar after lunch mom and dad decide to help me find some sand dollar but first dad say he have to stop at a store in town to get some thing for dinner he leave me to go ahead and look for sand dollar with mom when dad get back he help me look too i be look up and down around rock and in tide pool then i spot it partially stick out of the sand i find it my first sand dollar it be probably the only one on the beach for mile i put it in my treasure box this shell still sit in my box along with year of award pin button from athletics and scout and a swiss army knife i find in the wood where i use to live these thing keep a warm link to my past naragansett beach i find out year later doesnt have sand dollar but the local souvenir shop do keep in reserve for mom and dad who want to help their child build a memory,+ in yesteryear when + moby + dick was just a tadpole and the seas rolled and thundered over the jetties and onto the shore I searched for my first sand dollar still hidden somewhere in the ever stretching + naragansett + beach . + id been going there since I was a toddler not finding much more than sea weed and empty crab shells which were picked clean by the screeching sea gulls natures best garbage man . + now I was five I could run and search on my own no more holding hands with + mom and + dad .

9,Having already stretched and run a fourth of my distance  I arrived at my favorite spot and halted. It was the beginning of fall  the leaves of maple trees swirled down around me  crunching under my weight as I strode toward a gigantic tree trunk. Sitting  just taking in my surroundings  I noticed dusk turning to dark and decided to start home. As I moved to stand up  I saw something crouching across the road. I took a step back  it took a step forward. Fear hadnt registered yet  but my curiosity had. Walking forward to get a closer look  I recognized Bear  a neighbors friendly black lab. Sighing  I reached to pet the dog  but stopped short as a low rumble in the animals throat grew to a loud growl. I quickly pulled my hand to safety and backed off. Staring at the dog  I shrugged my shoulders in bewilderment  turned  and walked away. The clicking of the dogs claws on the pavement followed. Thinking nothing of it  I resumed my jogging  only to have the gigantic Labrador growling right at my heels again. Scared now  I broke into a run  and thats when the dog bit me  hard into the flesh of my leg. I fell to the ground  screaming in agony. The owner of the dog came out  wondering what the noise was about. Yanking on the dogs collar  the man struggled to pull the vicious animal off of me  which after several tries he managed to accomplish. While all this happened  another close neighbor who had witnessed the incident called 911. It was decided afterward that the dog had contracted rabies and he was soon put to sleep. I was given a series of shots and a few stitches only  and after a couple of years  my leg healed  but the scars remain on both the inside and out.   ,have already stretch and run a fourth of my distance i arrive at my favorite spot and halt it be the beginning of fall the leaf of maple tree swirl down around me crunch under my weight a i stride toward a gigantic tree trunk sit just take in my surroundings i notice dusk turn to dark and decide to start home a i move to stand up i saw something crouch across the road i take a step back it take a step forward fear hadnt register yet but my curiosity have walk forward to get a close look i recognize bear a neighbor friendly black lab sigh i reach to pet the dog but stop short a a low rumble in the animal throat grow to a loud growl i quickly pull my hand to safety and back off star at the dog i shrug my shoulder in bewilderment turn and walk away the clicking of the dog claw on the pavement follow think nothing of it i resume my jog only to have the gigantic labrador growl right at my heel again scar now i break into a run and thats when the dog bit me hard into the flesh of my leg i fell to the ground scream in agony the owner of the dog come out wonder what the noise be about yank on the dog collar the man struggle to pull the vicious animal off of me which after several try he manage to accomplish while all this happen another close neighbor who have witness the incident call it be decide afterward that the dog have contract rabies and he be soon put to sleep i be give a series of shot and a few stitch only and after a couple of year my leg heal but the scar remain on both the inside and out,+ having already stretched and run a fourth of my distance I arrived at my favorite spot and halted . + it was the beginning of fall the leaves of maple trees swirled down around me crunching under my weight as I strode toward a gigantic tree trunk . + sitting just taking in my surroundings I noticed dusk turning to dark and decided to start home . + as I moved to stand up I saw something crouching across the road .

9,For conservative Shakespeare lovers  the sound of a Romeo and Juliet updated for the 1990s is enough to evoke cries of blasphemy. Admittedly  the thought of the Bards timeless story of two young lovers being updated for an age group that doesnt have the attention span to read a Dr. Pepper label  much less deal with iambic pentameter  is frightening. However  director Baz Luhrmann manages to pull off an adaptation of the classic that neither waters down the brilliance of Shakespeare nor bores the average modern day audience. By casting the young and talented Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio  and sticking with the Shakespearean verse  Luhrmann creates a perfect modern classic. The Two households  both alike in dignity reside in fair Verona Beach  which represents modern-day Los Angeles. The battle between the two families is made evident by weapon-toting thugs whose cars sport Montague or Capulet license plates. A billboard examined closely advertises Lamour  not Coca-Cola. Such seemingly hokey touches are not so; rather  they add to the realism of Shakespeares language in a present-day setting. After one makes the easy adjustment of mentally balancing lyrical verse with the dazzling eye-candy setting and fast-paced action  Romeo and Juliet is entirely captivating. Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio are not just drool-elicitors for both the sexes  but strong actors who have the ability to speak Shakepeares language and draw the viewers into the tragedy. Although spoken differently  the verse is just as striking as in the theater. The innuendo is obvious when DiCaprio whines about being left unsatisfied in the balcony scene; Danes crooning about my only love sprung from my only hate is breathtaking. Danes does not allow DiCaprio to steal the show as a Juliet would be apt to do; she too gives a striking performance as Romeos passionate yet innocent desire. John Leguizamo plays perfectly the troublesome villain  Tybalt  and Harold Perrineau as Mercutio is a hilarious addition. The beauty and tragedy of the play begin at his death  as do the emotional movie-goers tears. One can cry all the way to the end of the film  as the lovers share a coffin in a candle-lit cathedral. Danes realistic sob at the realization of her lovers death causes a snicker from the average moviegoer  and the scene is altered a bit from its original form  but the emotion-packed climax is handled well. Not everyone will appreciate this new Romeo and Juliet  which  with its actors and its modern look  is clearly aimed at a younger audience. However  it is clear the film is more than bait for mall rats. The new version combines gripping action with the classic original verse to create a modern  open-minded Shakespeare-lovers dream. And even if one is not inclined to iambic pentameter  its two-hours traffic is exciting enough to keep those who only have the patience to read the Cliff Notes version from squirming in their seats. ,for conservative shakespeare lovers the sound of a romeo and juliet update for the s be enough to evoke cry of blasphemy admittedly the thought of the bard timeless story of two young lover be update for an age group that doesnt have the attention span to read a dr pepper label much less deal with iambic pentameter be frighten however director baz luhrmann manages to pull off an adaptation of the classic that neither water down the brilliance of shakespeare nor bore the average modern day audience by cast the young and talented claire dane and leonardo dicaprio and stick with the shakespearean verse luhrmann create a perfect modern classic the two household both alike in dignity reside in fair verona beach which represent modern day los angeles the battle between the two family be make evident by weapon tot thug whose car sport montague or capulet license plat a billboard examine closely advertise lamour not coca cola such seemingly hokey touch be not so rather they add to the realism of shakespeare language in a present day set after one make the easy adjustment of mentally balance lyrical verse with the dazzle eye candy set and fast paced action romeo and juliet be entirely captivate claire dane and leonardo dicaprio be not just drool elicitors for both the sex but strong actor who have the ability to speak shakepeares language and draw the viewer into the tragedy although speak differently the verse be just as striking a in the theater the innuendo be obvious when dicaprio whine about be leave unsatisfied in the balcony scene dane croon about my only love sprung from my only hate be breathtaking dane do not allow dicaprio to steal the show a a juliet would be apt to do she too give a striking performance a romeo passionate yet innocent desire john leguizamo play perfectly the troublesome villain tybalt and harold perrineau a mercutio be a hilarious addition the beauty and tragedy of the play begin at his death a do the emotional movie goer tear one can cry all the way to the end of the film a the lover share a coffin in a candle lit cathedral dane realistic sob at the realization of her lover death cause a snicker from the average moviegoer and the scene be alter a bit from it original form but the emotion pack climax be handle well not everyone will appreciate this new romeo and juliet which with it actor and it modern look be clearly aim at a young audience however it be clear the film be more than bait for mall rat the new version combine grip action with the classic original verse to create a modern open mind shakespeare lover dream and even if one be not incline to iambic pentameter it two hour traffic be excite enough to keep those who only have the patience to read the cliff note version from squirm in their seat,+ for conservative + shakespeare lovers the sound of a + romeo and + juliet updated for the 1990s is enough to evoke cries of blasphemy . + admittedly the thought of the + bards timeless story of two young lovers being updated for an age group that doesnt have the attention span to read a + dr . + pepper label much less deal with iambic pentameter is frightening . + however director + baz + luhrmann manages to pull off an adaptation of the classic that neither waters down the brilliance of + shakespeare nor bores the average modern day audience . + by casting the young and talented + claire + danes and + leonardo + dicaprio and sticking with the + shakespearean verse + luhrmann creates a perfect modern classic . + the + two households both alike in dignity reside in fair + verona + beach which represents modern - day + los + angeles . + the battle between the two families is made evident by weapon - toting thugs whose cars sport + montague or + capulet license plates .

10,I am a dynamic figure  often seen scaling walls and crushing ice. I have been known to remodel train stations on my lunch breaks  making them more efficient in the area of heat retention. I translate ethnic slurs for Cuban refugees. I write award-winning operas. I manage time efficiently. Occasionally  I tread water for three days in a row. I woo women with my sensuous and godlike trombone playing. I can pilot bicycles up severe inclines with unflagging speed  and I cook thirty-minute brownies in twenty minutes. I am an expert in stucco  a veteran in love  and an outlaw in Peru. Using only a hoe and a large glass of water  I once single-handedly defended a small village in the Amazon Basin from a horde of ferocious army ants. I play bluegrass cello. I was scouted by the Mets. I am the subject of numerous documentaries. When Im bored  I build large suspension bridges in my yard. I enjoy urban hang-gliding. On Wednesdays  after school  I repair electrical appliances for the elderly free of charge. I am an abstract artist  a concrete analyst  and a ruthless bookie. Critics worldwide swoon over my original line of corduroy evening wear. I dont perspire. I am a private citizen  yet I receive fan mail. I have been caller number nine and have won the weekend passes. Last summer I toured New Jersey with a traveling centrifugal-force demonstration. I bat .400. My deft floral arrangements have earned me fame in international botany circles. Children trust me. I can hurl tennis rackets at small moving objects with deadly accuracy. I once read Paradise Lost  Moby Dick  and David Copperfield in one day and still had time to refurbish an entire dining room that evening. I know the exact location of every food item in the supermarket. I have performed several covert operations for the CIA. I sleep once a week; when I do sleep  I sleep in a chair. While on vacation in Canada  I successfully negotiated with a group of terrorists who had seized a small bakery. The laws of physics do not apply to me. I balance  I weave  I dodge  I frolic  and my bills are all paid. On weekends  to let off steam  I participate in full contact origami. Years ago I discovered the meaning of life but forgot to write it down. I have made extraordinary four-course meals using only a mouli and a toaster oven. I breed prize winning clams. I have won bullfights in San Juan  cliff-diving competitions in Sri Lanka  and spelling bees at the Kremlin. I have played Hamlet  I have performed open-heart surgery  and I have spoken with Elvis.

9,Anticipating the Dream  And we are scatterlings of Africa On a journey to the stars Far below we leave forever Dreams of what we were. Johnny Clegg I am sitting with my grandparents in the spectators section of the echoing auditorium  my baby brother on my lap. Im not sure what I expected this morning  but thus far it has been an incredibly boring experience. The judge is half an hour late  and to add to that  Graeme  my brother  is tired and fussing  and would evidently much prefer his mothers lap to mine. Unfortunately for him  my parents and older brother are sitting on the other side of the room with almost 200 others. Thirty-one countries are represented here today. This is a citizenship ceremony. My parents  my older brother  and I were all born in South Africa. After living in the United States for 13 years  they are finally becoming citizens. I am not yet 18; consequently  I have to wait for my parents to obtain citizenship before I am eligible. All my younger siblings were born here  and are therefore Americans by birth. Graeme was only momentarily distracted by the book we brought along to amuse him. He is now struggling noisily to climb off my lap. Its time to bring out the secret weapon: candy. I just hope my supply doesnt dwindle too quickly. In our particular situation  it seems rather odd that the citizenship process works this way. Having lived here since I was two  I have always been more American than anything else. I dont speak Afrikaans  but my parents do (as well as English). I am the one who briefed my mother on American history and government before she took the citizenship test. Not only that  but I am always having to remind my parents that the word is flashlight  not torch  and that here in America we have a tooth fairy  not a mouse  who comes to fetch our teeth. After today  my parents will be Americans  and I will be the unique one  the alien  the only South African remaining in our house. How bureaucratic of the American government to work that way. The judge has arrived  and now that everyone has stopped talking  Graeme has started to cry. I make a hasty retreat up the slanted aisle to the back of the room. Maybe I can rock him to sleep. I have often asked my parents why we moved here from our homeland  and from what Ive gathered  there are several reasons. Foremost is apartheid  the total segregation of South Africa  whereby whites held all power and blacks were not even allowed to vote. The government established separate buses  bathrooms  even public lawns. My parents  who are by no means radical  were very strongly against apartheid and were arrested for protesting. They were released in the next moment because they were white  while their black friends were hauled off to jail. The atmosphere was growing more volatile every day  and when the building across the street from where my mother worked was bombed  my parents decided that it was no longer safe to stay  especially with two small children. Consequently  my father took advantage of the first opportunity to get a job here in America. It must be incredibly difficult to live in a country that is so immoral  where people are looked down upon simply because their skin happens to be a different shade. How can you pledge allegiance to a government responsible for the obvious evil around you every day? America was segregated at one point also  but at least the government called it separate but equal. In South Africa  the government did not even attempt to bring about equality. Can anyone take pride in a government like that? Graeme is finally asleep  drooling on my shoulder  and I can return  victorious  to my seat. The judge has been giving a speech about the privileges and responsibilities that come with being an American citizen. Im beginning to understand why my parents are so excited about this day. At first I expected nothing of great importance to occur in this ceremony. I imagined we would arrive here  say the Pledge of Allegiance  and my parents would receive a piece of paper declaring them American citizens. As it turns out  a lot more is involved than the mere title. Today my parents will not only become eligible to vote and serve on jury duty  but they will automatically become part of American history  culture  and society. The United States becomes their country  a land that kindles pride. All of a sudden  they have a duty to serve this country and to be loyal to it above all others. It is a colossal decision for them to make. South Africa is a beautiful nation. My parents grew up there and have many fond recollections. They remember visiting game preserves and finding lions in the middle of the road. They remember going to school with their friends and tormenting substitute teachers. The different snacks they ateâ€”biltong  Chappie gum  and Bovrilâ€”could never be found in the United States. My parents remember getting married in the city of Florida on February 2  1980. Im certain it must have been difficult to leave everything  including family  and move to America. Now  at this ceremony  everything is becoming finalized. They will no longer be a part of South Africa  but South Africa will always be a part of them. They have given up the past in anticipation of the future  one filled with hope for greater peace  prosperity  and happiness: the American Dream.I scan the room  the many different faces of my fellow spectators: grandparents  parents  and children of various races. Anyone can read the pride in their eyes as they watch their loved ones from across the room. I snap to attention. People are rising. This is the moment; they are about to take the oath. Now I have grown just as excited as my parents seemed to be this morning. My mothers smile tells me she is enjoying herself. Right hands raised  the would-be citizens repeat after the judge the words that will change their lives forever. Piles of paperwork and months of waiting are now fulfilled in a few simple words. As the final echoes of the judges words die out  I hardly hear his congratulations. One fact only is the focus of my thoughts: my parents and another brother are Americans. All my older brothers and my sister are Americans. Soon it will be my turn  and I can hardly wait.,anticipate the dream and we be scatterlings of africa on a journey to the star far below we leave forever dream of what we be johnny clegg i be sit with

9,Lets kill em! Bob exclaims as we walk toward the stadium. Id love to see Zach Thomas crush Thurman Thomas  I reply. We are not brutal people; we are simply expressing our need to win at all costs. The Miami Dolphins are playing the Buffalo Bills  their most hated opponent. We had this game circled on the calendar since training camp began. The thermometer on this Monday night reads a cool 68 degrees  but the atmosphere in the stadium burns like desert heat. It doesnt get better than this  Bob says as we occupy our seats just a few rows up from the end zone.  I wouldnt trade this for anything else  I reply. You  me  the fans  the noise  the action: what more could I want? The countdown to the opening kickoff nears five minutes. The crowd files in while the players run onto the field through the giant inflated Dolphins helmet. Everyone stands united during the singing of the national anthem. The Bills win the coin toss  and they choose to receive the opening kickoff. Thats the only thing you guys are gonna win tonight! I jest. Bob has lived with my mother and me for five years  and he will marry my mother this coming March. Fortunately  I never experienced the crisis of anguish and rebellion that many children suffer in divorces and remarriages. From the beginning  I felt comfortable around him. He never attempted to dominate the household or me. Naturally  though  we did not immediately feel a bond as strong as the one I share with my parents. Football sparked the beautiful friendship we have. Football never interested me earlier in my life. I thought of it as a pointless sport in which a bunch of fat men jumped on top of each other. I rolled my eyes the first time Bob spoke about football. I figured I would have to put up with this nonsense until I left for college. Lovely  I thought. Just lovely.  I reluctantly allowed Bob to teach me the workings of the game. As he helped me analyze the game  I started distinguishing linebackers from running backs in a dogpile. We picked apart defenses as a quarterback would  and I called penalties before the referees did. The underlying organization of the game revealed itself to me  and its logic suited my predominantly left-brained mind perfectly. More importantly  though  football fostered a common bonding ground for us. Touchdown  your Miami Dolphins! the announcer proclaims. Sixty-five thousand aqua-clad Dolphin fans stand cheering in the aisles; thirteen thousand blue-clothed  blue-faced Bills fans slouch dejectedly in their seats. Bob and I carry out our own touchdown ritual: we alternate high fives between our left and right hands six times: one for each point scored. Olindo Mare kicks the ball through the goalposts as if aiming at us  and we exchange another high five for the extra point. The Dolphins jingle echoes off the walls of the stadium while the residual smoke of fireworks blankets the stadium. They just cant beat our defense  Bob says in awe. The Dolphins take a quick 10-0 lead  and our devastating defense destroys the determination of the Bills when they threaten to score. The Bills offense drives down to the three-yard line after the Dolphin defense commits a pass-interference penalty. They attempt two runs and a pass; all three fail. On fourth down  they must kick a field goal  but they fail to convert the kick to a score because a linebacker blocks the kick. Bob and I howl like wolves and bump chests. We savor the goal-line stand as we laugh at the Buffalo fans seated two rows in front of us. After just half a season  football established itself as an institution in my household. Every Sunday  I found myself glued to the television screen for nine hours soaking up football. Consequently  I spent a good amount of time with Bob on our reclining couch  by far the best place for guys to talk. Most of the talking involved football  but beer and car commercials supplied key opportunities for other topics to slip into conversation  such as my schoolwork  my progress in karate  his job  and his latest scuba dives. Deeper subjects such as marriage  my relationship with my father  and our feelings about my mother came up as well. Football provided us with the perfect excuse to get to know each other. And thats the end of the half with your Miami Dolphins leading the Buffalo Bills twenty to ten. We leaned back in our seats and put football aside for a while. So when are you taking the SAT? Bob asks. Im taking it in April. It doesnt count  though  you know. I just want to see how good my verbal is so that I know what improvements I have to make.  So  do you have any girl interests right now?  No  not really. There was this one girl I liked a few weeks ago  but shes too fake for me. Hows work going? Its all right. Some of the tech stocks took big hits this week  but the pharmaceuticals went up nicely. When are you going to Minnesota to visit your dad?  Not this coming weekend  but the next one. Its starting to get pretty cold up there. We continue talking until the game resumes. Miami scores a quick touchdown to secure its lead. The offense drives on cruise control  and the defense stands its ground. Time winds down  and the Dolphins win by a score of 30-13. The victory song (Na-na  na  nah; Na-na  na  nah; Hey  hey-ey  good-bye) plays over the speakers. Players run to the locker room raising their helmets high above their heads; fans stream into the parking lot  shouting cheers of supremacy. That was awesome. My words dribble hoarsely after yelling for hours. We couldnt have played a better game. You got that right. Marino got us 30 points tonight  we only allowed one touchdown  and Mare was perfect on his kicking. Its always great to leave the stadium like this. Especially after Monday-nighters. The last thing Id want is to lose  sulk on the way home  and then get only three hours of sleep because Ive got school the next day. Phew  Im so tired. The intensity just wears me out. I had a great time  Dave. Its always fun watching with you. You get so into it. Youre a nut! Through our mutual enjoyment of football  I have acquired a more son-like warmth toward Bob. That change reflects Bobs transition from visiting us to living with us. I do not say  Hey  Bob  hows it going? anymore; instead  I greet him with Good morning  Bob. What are you doing today? I am the son he never had  and he fills in some of the holes that my father left when he moved to Minnesota. Amazingly enough  it all started with a brown pigskin ball. The beauty of football lies in its power to unite crowds. The beauty of love lies in its power to unite individuals.,let kill em bob exclaims a we walk toward the stadium id love to see zach thomas crush thurman thomas i reply we be not brutal people we be

9,I look at the old tin building; it seems to have been there since the beginning of time. Its strong posts and nonchalant slouch make me wonder if it will be rooted in the same place forever. As soon as I walk in  the strong  rustic smell of hickory wood assails me. It takes me back to my familys last Fourth of July barbecue  when the hickory chips smoking the ribs gave off their thick aroma. I wait for my eyes to adjust in the dark  humid place  not taking a step until they do because of the ageless spider that could have made its home in my path. My tongue already asks for a drink of water as I breathe the musty air littered with sawdust. Spraying on sticky repellent  I wonder if the thirsty mosquitoes will stay away. I walk to my work area  making sure I do not trip over the precious finds and the hopeful antiques. I brush against a wall of the old building that is really more of a shed  and a mat of spiderwebs clings to my shirt and refuses to come off. The gentle hum of the small fans and the roar of the monster ones fight against the humid air. I pull out a machine that is supposed to tie the two-pound bags that are full of hickory chips  but it has a mind of its own. Placing the bulky machine on the high bench with its layers of gritty sawdust  I hope it has decided to work today and load a bag into it. As I pull down the top of the machine  I stare it in its mechanical eyes  willing it to work. I pull the bag back out of the machine and look down on another battle lost. For now the brute has won the war of wills  and I prepare myself with a box of red ties to close all 1 000 of the smooth bags by hand. The clang of the shovel dumping its first load onto the ancient scale can be heard throughout the shed  signaling that work has begun. The salty sweat begins to bead on my forehead  and for the first of many times  I wipe it away  leaving a smudge of dirt and dust. Already I yell First shower! to assure my place in line after our work is completed. I hear my three sisters shout numbers throughout the shed. Amanda  the last to call a number  frowns  knowing she will have to wait a long time for the hot water to return after all the showers. My grandfather walks into the shed  a cane in one hand and a pack of icy cold colas in the other. His deep Southern drawl permeates the building as he asks if weve had lunch yet. Our eyes brighten and smiles play on our faces as we silently hope he will offer the traditional sloppy whopper and golden fries. He leaves as silently as he came in  and our stomachs start to growl with anticipation for lunch. My sisters and aunts chatting and soft laughter has started as they begin to catch up on each others lives. I look around  wondering what people would say if they could see the Horne sisters outside of the house with no makeup on and their hair in disarray. I laugh and keep the thoughts to myself  listening in as my aunts next story begins. At the end of the day  when all of the work is done  I pull the palletâ€”our makeshift gateâ€”closed and pet my grandfathers latest endeavor at a vicious watchdog. I sigh with relief that its over.

9,Congratulations  you have a new baby boy! my child-development teacher said as she handed over the 10-pound bundle. Last year in my high school child-development class  each student had to take the Think-It-Over baby home for a night to get a taste of parenthood. Even before I received the baby  I knew I was not ready to be a parent as a senior in high school. I could still remember when my brother and sister were little and I would have to take care of them all the time. At least the doll had no dirty diapers I would have to change. It was a Friday night when my turn came to take the 10-pound plastic doll home. The doll really did look like a live baby from a distance. It even had a pleasant baby powder smell. After I took the baby home in his car seat  I changed him into some really cute clothes because my friends and I were going out that night. I then decided to name him Tyler. Inside the body of this doll was a computer that was programmed to make periodic crying sounds. I was the only person who could stop the crying because I had the key. This key  tied to my wrist  could be inserted in the dolls back to stop the crying. So far  so good. The doll had not cried  yet. My friends came over  and we all piled into the car. It was kind of squished because we had the babys seat in there  too. I had to treat the doll like a real baby because the computer inside also measured any abuse to the doll  such as shaking or neglect. The hour-long drive to the restaurant was uneventful. It was rather chilly  so I decided to wrap Tyler in a blanket and carry him in that way. I also had a diaper bag with diapers  a bottle  and an extra set of clothes hanging on my arm. Because it was Friday night  there were a lot of people waiting in line to get a table. When I walked into that crowded entryway  I got some very weird looks and quite a few raised eyebrows. My friends also noticed the glares and stares  so we decided to make a game out of the whole situation. I stood in the corner pretending to rock Tyler to sleep. Every once in a while my friends would peek in the blanket and say  Oh  how cute. I could not help but laugh. And although it was funny to my friends and me  some of the people did not think it was so funny that I had a baby. I overheard one couple say  Why would she bring a baby here? These people were giving me rude looks and forming judgments about me because they thought I was a teenage mom. Others just smiled at me sympathetically and felt sorry for me because I was only a child with a child.  We finally got a table  and the waiter  not knowing I was carrying a doll  asked me if I needed a high chair. I told him it was just a doll  but a high chair would be good. He thought it was funny that I actually dared to bring a doll into the restaurant  so he brought a high chair  plus a red balloon for the little one. Again  during our meal  my friends and I received strange looks from the others in the restaurant. One couple kept walking by our table just to get a look at my baby. I think they were trying to figure out if the doll was an actual baby. As the couple walked by  my friends and I started discussing how people so quickly judged me and assumed that I was the mother of the baby. We decided that we would probably do the same if we saw a teenage girl coming in with a child and a group of friends. Teenage pregnancy is not accepted where I live and is definitely not the norm; many girls would hide their pregnancies if they decided to keep their babies. We went to the mall after we were finished eating  and I had to take Tyler with me. My friends were looking at clothes  but I couldnt because I was carrying this baby (which was becoming quite heavy). So I just roamed around wishing I could try on clothes  too. Then the baby started to cry this horrible imitation babys cry. It was so loud and terrible. I quickly put the key into the dolls back so it would quit crying  and then I had to explain to the salesclerk why I was carrying around a plastic doll. I was so glad to finally go home. I learned a lot through my experience with the Think-It-Over baby. The doll definitely reinforced my thinking that I was not ready to be a parent  but it also made me more aware of the larger picture. It opened my eyes to the judgments people make about others. People do not realize that some things are not the way they seem. The doll seemed like it was my baby  but that was not the case. I was only carrying it around for a class project. The people in the restaurant were so quick to judge me because they assumed I was a teenage mom. They undoubtedly thought I was stupid for taking a baby to a noisy  smoky place; they didnt realize it was just a plastic doll underneath that blanket. I sometimes catch myself judging people I do not know  just because of the first impression they give. In reality  I do not have a clue about their real stories. I especially think people judge teenage girls with babies too quickly. Sure  they may have made a mistake  but the girls usually know that  and they are the ones who have to pay the price. I only experienced the glares and rude comments for one night  but I thought of all the girls who have to deal with these looks wherever they go. We should all be slower to judge these girls  or anyone else  and realize that some things are not as they seem.,congratulation you have a new baby boy my child development teacher say a she hand over

9,Some people express themselves through beautiful art; others are masters of the page and speak silently through writing. I  on the other hand  express myself with the greatest instrument I have  my voice. I make my living by speaking to groups large and small. Nothing gives me more satisfaction than public speaking  and my interest in public speaking began when I was quite young. At age eight I realized that I belonged in front of an audience. I started giving demonstrations and speeches in local county 4-H competitions until I was eligible to participate in state competitions. I won every state competition that I entered. Soon other public speaking opportunities arose; I represented an artist named Ann Cross at the Art Walk in Keene and was an active participant on the debate team and the captain in eighth grade. During March of eighth grade  I had the best opportunity yet to practice my oratorical skills: I was selected  out of all the students entered in New Hampshire  to write and read a four-minute speech on national television. My job was to introduce Elizabeth Dole  who at the time was interested in running for president. I was notified the day before the event and so had only one night to write and memorize my speech. When I arrived the next morning in Bedford  New Hampshire  I was greeted by photographers  camera crews  and newspaper reporters! Then I was escorted backstage to meet Elizabeth Dole. After speaking briefly with her and having her review my speech  we marched through a crowd of flashing bulbs to our places on the stage. Soon it was time for my speech. I was introduced  and as I walked to the podium  I couldnt help but smile at the audience. I had a feeling of complete exhilaration flowing through my veins. When I finished  I received a standing ovation  and Mrs. Dole surprised me by giving me a great hug and thanking me for my comments on the importance of education. But even after she finished speaking  the excitement was far from over. I was with her for all her photographs  and I was interviewed for a few moments by WMUR and later by the Keene Sentinel. After the media finished with us  I met various supporters of Mrs. Doles. They were all happy to meet me and flooded me with questions and praise. I truly felt on top of the world. After that  I participated in various competitions and events. My favorite by far was Young Chataqua  a wonderful summer program. In Chataqua I portrayed the life of Margaret Bourke-White  a pioneer photographer  in a 12-minute monologue that took a month to research  prepare  and memorize. It was an amazing experience. Although the other students and I were only expected to perform our monologues once  two other organizations asked me to speak. After Chataqua  I participated in my first play  Everybodys Crazy  and I organized a debate team at my high school. I continued my 4-H activities  did volunteer work  went to Chataqua each year  and participated in the American Legions Oratorical Contest. Those powerful first experiences transformed my life and gave me a career that I love. As I look back on a life shaped by public speaking  I feel a great debt of gratitude to that eight-year-old girl who first got up in front of crowds at the county fair. She helped me become the person I am today.,some people express themselves through beautiful art others be master of the page and speak silently through write i on the other hand express myself with the great instrument i have my voice i make my living by speak to group large and small nothing give me more satisfaction than public speaking and my interest in public speaking begin when i be quite young at age eight i realize that i belong in front of an audience i start give demonstration and speech in local county h competition until i be eligible to participate in state competition i win every state competition that i enter soon other public speaking opportunity arise i represent an artist name ann cross at the art walk in keene and be an active participant on the debate team and the captain in eighth grade during march of eighth grade i have the best opportunity yet to practice my oratorical skill i be select out of all the student enter in new hampshire to write and read a four minute speech on national television my job be to introduce elizabeth dole who at the time be interested in run for president i be notify the day before the event and so have only one night to write and memorize my speech when i arrive the next morning in bedford new hampshire i be greet by photographer camera crew and newspaper reporter then i be escort backstage to meet elizabeth dole after speak briefly with her and have her review my speech we march through a crowd of flash bulb to our place on the stage soon it be time for my speech i be introduce and a i walk to the podium i couldnt help but smile at the audience i have a feeling of complete exhilaration flow through my vein when i finish i receive a stand ovation and mrs dole surprise me by give me a great hug and thank me for my comment on the importance of education but even after she finish speak the excitement be far from over i be with her for all her photograph and i be interview for a few moment by wmur and later by the keene sentinel after the medium finish with u i meet various supporter of mr dole they be all happy to meet me and flood me with question and praise i truly felt on top of the world after that i participate in various competition and event my favorite by far be young chataqua a wonderful summer program in chataqua i portray the life of margaret bourke white a pioneer photographer in a minute monologue that take a month to research prepare and memorize it be an amazing experience although the other student and i be only expect to perform our monologue once two other organization ask me to speak after chataqua i participate in my first play everybodys crazy and i organize a debate team at my high school i continue my h activity do volunteer work go to chataqua each year and participate in the american legion oratorical contest those powerful first experience transform my life and give me a career that i love a i look back on a life shape by public speaking i feel a great debt of gratitude to that eight year old girl who first get up in front of crowd at the county fair she help me become the person i be today,+ some people express themselves through beautiful art ; others are masters of the page and speak silently through writing .

9,Most of the snapshots of my life are held in the photo albums of my mind. Some were captured by a camera  and those pictures I keep in a shoebox under my bed. Im lucky to have shoebox photos of the earliest things I can remember. For example  three days after my third birthday  Katherine Emily arrived. I remember my dad taking me to see my new baby sister; we stopped at a gas station on the way to the hospital and bought my mom candy and a cola. That day  the camera caught the tiny smile only a big sister could have as she holds one of the best birthday presents ever. I dont take up even half of a blue hospital chair as I cradle Katie in my arms. She is wrapped all in white  like the little angel that every baby is. My white  hooded sweatshirt has faint patches of sky blue  and just a tiny crimson triangle of a T-shirt peeks out from behind the zipper. Looking closer  a third person can be seen: my mothers wrist-banded hand holds Katies head up. My tiny arms werent quite strong enough for that task. That was the first time I ever posed with Katie. Looking at that photo makes me remember all the other pictures I have of Katie and me  even when there was no camera with film and batteries ready to go. Its these pictures that Ill never lose. Before Katie and I went off to school  we spent our days in the tunnels and caves of cardboard boxes and secret hideaways under the kitchen table. Our house has never been short on toys (there were six kids born before Katie and me)  but boxes have always been a favorite. I remember being able to easily slide through the long passageways  my back not even brushing against the ceilings of our tunnels and forts. Katie had an even easier time but often needed a flashlight in the darkness. Our cities of cardboard were draped in rainbows of blankets and quilts. On the insides  however  the less light we had  the better. Its too bad my memory camera has no flash. Picture Sales were the basis for the kids economy in our house. Competition was fierce in our system of capitalism. Jake is three years older than I am  and Im three years older than Katie  but we all tried to outdo each other drawing pictures  attractively placing them around our bedrooms  and bringing in the customers. Prices ranged from 1 to 25 cents  and we loved counting the money at the end of the night. Katie and I often combined our assets and tried to steal Jakes business. Our walls were lined with neat rows of crayon drawings. We stocked anything from flowers to people  but supportive parents and older siblings made purchases from all of us. Katie and I loved having our big sister Megan take us for summer walks. She was in high school  and hanging out with her added coolness to our status at Winkler Elementary. Filled with excess energy on the way to the park  beach  or the Hunny Tree gas station for pop and candy  we always loved to run ahead. Megan would let us  usually to the next telephone pole or two  where we would have to stop and wait for her. Shorter legs made the telephone pole seem distant  growing slowly closer as the Queen Annes lace flew past in the ditch. I can recall countless times that Katie and I woke up late and found ourselves running down the road to catch the bus. Looking back  this has to be one of the more ironic rolls of my memory film  because I ended up running cross-country; Katie wound up in poms and football. Of my six sisters  Katie is the closest to me in age  and shes often been my closest companion during family events. We are usually the only teenage kids around at family gatherings and on shopping trips in the family van. This explains why Katie and I are expert mimes. The shopping trips provide hours of being stuffed in the van with our younger siblings  Scarlet and Michael; the visits to Minnesota to see relatives yield seven hours of driving each way. On one occasion  Katie and I boarded the van  choosing the back seat. After 10 minutes of being annoyed by everyone else  we formed an invisible wall between the two front seats and ourselves. We mimed a smooth  perfectly flat  soundproof surface to perfection. The last picture on that roll of memories was Mom telling us to stop it. The Niagara Falls/Canada/New York trip last year was the closest Katie and I have been. The same week of our shared 16th and 13th birthday-bonfire party  we spent days cramped in the back of my sister Saras car  next to her one-year-old daughter  Hannah. Our quiet brother-in-law Brad was driving  and Hannah cried the whole way. That trip provided enough scenes to make a full-length movie  but I have only one shoebox picture of Katie and me in front of Niagara Falls. We are both bundled up like we were in the picture taken 13 years earlier. This time  though  we wear dark blue jeans and gray sweatshirts  our matching brown hair pulled back  hers in a ponytail and mine behind a pale pink bandana. The background doesnt take us to a quiet hospital room  but to the continuous rumble of beautiful Niagara Falls. On the left  the American Falls turn over beneath a rainbow of October foliage. Farther away  on the right  Horseshoe Falls bubbles under a mist that slowly rises above the horizon. Katie and I lean against the heavy  black railing  and against each other. Our smiles are sweet and happy  reminiscent of Katies first birthday. These two shoebox pictures of Katie and me are just two snapshots in a shared photo album  filled with every cake  thought  joke  and sweater weve shared. In the midst of looking through the collection  Katie yells at me  Hey  thats my shirt! You borrow my stuff  I reply. Not without asking. You had my black skirt for three months. I asked for it. I let the fight peter out  not wishing to waste a memory on an argument about clothes. There will be plenty of hair-pulling  name-calling  and angry situations between Katie and me to come. I want to save my film for better times.,most of the snapshot of my life be hold in the photo album of my mind some be capture by a camera and those picture i keep in a shoebox under my bed im lucky to have shoebox photo of the early thing i can remember for example three day after my third birthday katherine emily arrive i remember my dad take me to see my new baby sister we stop at a gas

9,My day in Africa was one Ill not soon forget. I toured two major cities of Moroccoâ€”land of mystery  enticement  and enchantment. I was expecting belly dancers  snake charmers  and many exotic sights filled with color and intricate decoration. While I did see some of what I expected  the majority of what I saw was totally unexpected and will haunt me forever. As I boarded the ship that was to take me across the Mediterranean Sea to the northern shores of Morocco  I felt an array of mixed emotions. Mainly  I was excited. After all  I was only 13 and about to become tricontinental. The previous five days I had spent in sunny Spain  and now I was to travel to Africa for one day. Besides excited  I also felt deeply intrigued and mystified. Moroccans practice the Muslim religion  and Arabic is one of their main languages. This may seem a bit prejudiced  but as I took my seat in the boat  the song Arabian Nights was playing over and over in my mind. However  I was dressed very conservatively so as not to offend anybody. The boat ride took only about 45 minutes. After we had docked and debarked the ship  we were led straight to a bus. My first glimpse of Africa wasnt too exciting  since it was just pretty much like Andalucia  the southern region of Spain. It was a little warmer here  though  being so close to the equator. We rode for a while and then stopped to have our passports checked in a city owned by Spain. This is when I had my first real glimpse of Morocco. There was trash strewn all over alongside the old  cracked pavement of the road. Natives attending to their business stopped for a moment to stare at the tour bus that held so many foreigners. Of course  they could scarcely see us because of the tinted tour bus windows  but their dark eyes seemed to pierce straight through me. It was at this point that the Moroccan tour guide joined us. He was very short and wore a long white robe. A small maroon hat adorned his head. He spoke to us in a heavy accent that sounded sort of Spanish  warning us not to talk to any Moroccans on the streets because they would try to steal from us. He also warned us not to buy anything from the peddlers on the street  for the same reasons. He told us that the people would flock around us  harassing and trying to take advantage of us. I didnt particularly pay attention  however  because I had heard these speeches when we were warned about the gypsies in Spain  and the gypsies had caused little trouble. I assumed the Moroccans would be the same. After the guide gave his speech  we drove to TÃ©touan  one of the major cities of Morocco. I can remember thinking wed never make it there because the narrow dirt road was built a mere two or three feet from a sheer drop-off. When we finally reached TÃ©touan about an hour later  I looked excitedly out of my window  hoping to see a city in better condition than that of the Spanish town we had just left. But what I saw shocked me. Huge crowds of people stopped everything they were doing to stare at us. Most of them wore dirty  tattered clothing and were startlingly thin. I couldnt help but stare  despite all our tour guides warnings. My mom gave me a gentle nudge. I hugged my camera closer to my body and stepped off the bus. Almost immediately  the native Moroccans began to step closer to our tour group. Their staring eyes burned straight into my mind. I felt like such an intruder because of the way they stared. My first feeling of guilt came when a woman holding a crying baby accidentally brushed up against me. I somehow managed to apologize  not wanting to offend her in any way. She just looked at me with sad  troubled eyes that seemed to say  How could you? How could you allow us to live this terrible life in a third-world country? I instantly felt gratitude for everything I had ever taken for granted. We were led through the narrow back streets of the main section of town. There were high  white walls of buildings on either side of us. These walls had open doorways that were the entryways to small rooms  which were homes. People appeared in these doorways and stared at us as if we were gods. Emaciated children in dirty scraps of clothing played in the trash and filth in the alleyways. They gazed up at us and smiled. I always smiled back  while I wondered if they knew there were better ways of life in other parts of the world  or whether they learned that as they became older. Our Moroccan guide led us through small  filthy alleyways that had a distinctive odor that someone said was marijuana. Perhaps these people felt that drugs were their only way of escaping terrible lives. We were led past a small opening in the walls. We could hear the screaming and crying of a small boy  about three or four years old. His right leg  from the knee down  was gushing blood. My stomach rolled over  and I wished desperately that there were something I could do to help him. A woman wrapped gauze around the wound  but the blood soaked straight through. I felt so rude just walking right past. A little while later  we were led into a quaint little restaurant. I didnt eat much; walking past all those sights had taken away my appetite. But I will never forget the bathroom in that restaurant. When I paid the woman attendant 100 pesetas (about 70 cents)  she led me into a stall. After I had finished  the woman flushed by hand. She then poured some bottled water on my hands and squirted on soap. After I lathered  she rinsed my hands with more bottled water and pointed to the door  signaling that I was to leave. When everyone had finished eating and had used the bathroom  we got back on the bus for another hours drive to Tangiers. I honestly didnt think I could take any more. When we reached Tangiers  the peddlers on the street flocked around us. I told all of them  politely but somewhat guiltily  No  thank you. We went straight to an indoor bazaar. There we could bargain all we wanted  but I didnt really want anything. I felt badly giving money to big businesses that didnt need it as much as the people on the streets did. The rest of the time in Tangiers was basically like our time in TÃ©touan  except that there were a great many more peddlers. After we came out of one shop  a man approached me with Moroccan hats called fezzes  which he sold for 2000 pesetas  or about 10 dollars. I said  No  thank you. The man replied  Oh  you buy from in store but dont buy from the street  eh? I honestly didnt know what to say  so I just said  Im sorry. His reply was  I bet. I just kept on walking  feeling very guilty. But as it turned out  he gave my mom a 1000 peseta discount  so she bought three of the hats. As I boarded the bus  I felt relieved to be leaving Morocco behind me. But then I looked back at all the people  some of them children  and thought how difficult it must be to have to go through hardships every single day  hardships worse than anything we modern Americans have ever endured. I was leaving Morocco  but these people had no way out. Even today  the sights and sounds of its cities still haunt me. I suppose those memories always will.,my day in africa be one ill not soon forget i tour two major city of morocco land of mystery enticement and enchantment i be expect belly dancer snake charmer and

9,High school alone is the hardest part of any teenagers life  but when it gets mixed in with an awkward adolescents idea of liking someone  life turns into a whirlwind emotional adventure. Like my plate wasnt overflowing already with a chemistry teacher who called me Crash (a name I acquired after dropping a beaker during our first lab)  a sassy algebra teacher who said that I didnt have the aptitude for the subject  or a French teacher who flirted with the class and laughed at her own jokes. No  I complicated things even further because  stupid me  I fell in love. It all started one morning at my locker as I fumbled to find the French book I hadnt used in about a month. In the crowded locker bay someone stepped on my toes and  consequently  rammed me into the absolute zenith of high school popularity standing to my right. I accidentally hit Miss Popularity while she attempted to apply lipstick. In the reflection of the three mirrors that hung in her locker  I saw a red smear across her acne-free  rouged cheek. I also saw the image of the person responsible for this collision. When I turned to get a better glimpse  there he was. Lockers may have slammed  Miss Popularity may have pouted  but everything stopped for me. All I saw was him. It felt like someone had reached down my throat and  with strong fingers  drawn my breath and stomach from my trembling body. His sapphire eyes drilled deep into my heart  and every nuance of his face became eternally etched into my mind. The tall  thin body stood out like a glistening jewel among the dull coal of the locker bay. Sensing my eyes burning deep into him  he turned around and said  Ah  sorry. My bad. The words were spoken by a voice that could talk a man down from a ledge. I could tell by the tone and inflection that he felt deep remorse in his soul for displacing my bodyâ€”or maybe the burrito he had at lunch didnt agree with him  Im not really sure. From that moment on  during every free second  I suddenly became busy thinking about him. Wondering about this boy made sleepless nights overflow with sweet images. Dull math periods were filled with idle daydreams. I became obsessed with this senior with Chris Pine blue eyes. I wasnt the only one who decided that having Blue Eyes as a boyfriend was a good idea. Miss Popularity decided that he  out of all the salivating dogs begging  whimpering  pawing for her attention  would be the perfect playful puppy. Worse yet  I had to witness her primitive flirting ritual in the lunchroom. She would strut toward the soda machine  swaying her hips from side to side  in an effort to catch one of his incandescent blue eyes. She was beautiful and she knew it. This was when it really started to get goodâ€”for him I mean. Purposely  her skirt inched up revealing her fleshy thigh as she struggled to remove a quarter nestled in her warm pocket. Blue Eyes was rabid with lust. Foam gushed out of his mouth and fire burned within his eyes. He was imagining the heat of the metal  so close to her body  then falling from her manicured hand to the floor. As he picked the coin up  those blue eyes examined every centimeter of her shapely legs. He was so close he could smell the sweetness of her perfume mixed with laundry detergent and the playful scent of teenage girl. The whole scene caused a churning in my stomach  which turned to a hopeless nausea. The colorful world of love turned into a black  grey pit. Every strand of my hair hung like a 400-pound weight. There was no way I was going to give in to Miss Popularity  who just happened to be my best friend. Yes  yes  I was the goofy sidekick. She could turn the world on with her smile  and I couldnt turn the world on with anything. Through friends  acquaintances  and the grueling detailed accounts from Miss Popularity  I slowly gained more knowledge about my new love. Oh  Lisa  he smells so good! Smile. Yeah  Miss Popularity  I bet anything with a pulse smells good to you. And hes so sweet! Bigger smile. Oh  and why is he so sweet? Maybe its that shapely body of yours. But I might have to work on his style a bit. Then hell be really hot! Smile. Nod. Then hell be hot!? If the kid got any hotter hed be illegal in 37 states and 2 territories! This boy should not be allowed to roam around in public. All the basicsâ€”name  address  and hobbiesâ€”slowly unfolded  and an elaborate plan of action for an encounter started to form in my mind. But before it had a chance to fully develop  I had a surprise Blue Eyes sighting. He came to my photography class during one of his study halls (by this time I knew his schedule) to do extra work on one of his pictures. My mind raced; my hands shook. Should I act like I like him? Should I not notice him? Should I talk to him? Talk to him. Hes your best friends boyfriend. Talk to him! Oh  how can I look at his cherubic face when I know hell be looking back at mine? I dont believe it. Hes got to be kidding. I dont believe hes wearing that shirt. He looks so good in that shirt. How can I talk to someone who looks that good in a shirt? That cotton clings to just the right places  and his jeans are sculpted to enhance and accentuate that squeezably softâ€¦ So distracted by the mental roller coaster I was on  I couldnt speak when he said  Phat print. Left with my eyes agog  I missed my one opportunity to speak with that walking  talking piece of artwork. Days dragged on and so did Miss Popularitys relationship with Blue Eyes. He would nip at her heels as they walked down the hall. They would cuddle in class  and she would even feed him at lunch! Whatever the phoniest couple thing that youve seen  they did it. Im surprised that people werent driven to violent nausea and fits of puking when they saw them together. But like most good things  their relationship had to come to an unfortunate end. After Blue Eyes wasnt such a new puppy for Miss Popularity  their relationship deteriorated. From what I gathered after late night confessionals with Miss Popularity  he wasnt learning any new tricks. Later that year I went to his graduation  and with the toss of his cap and the flip of his tassel  a sense of defeat and despair filled my body. Good-bye. Jesus Mary Joseph  you are such an idiot. You obsessed over him for almost a year! Do you realize you never spoke one word to him? Not a single syllable. Yes  but if you had he would have laughed at you and your silly  girlish crush. You didnt deserve him in the first place. Oh  but I really liked him. I liked him so much  and he didnt even know I was alive! Get over it. Half the school doesnt even know youre alive. I watched his blue Honda Civic race away. With the peel of the tires and the smell of burning rubber  I knew he had gone forever. Then the pain lifted from my body  like a heavy weight  and was replaced by a feeling of accomplishment and relief. I made it through the grueling torture of a high school crush and lived to tell about it. There existed no class project hard enough or cafeteria food indigestible enough to even compare.,high school alone be the hard part of any teenager life but when it get mixed in with an awkward adolescent idea of like someone life turn into a whirlwind emotional adventure like my plate wasnt overflow already with a chemistry teacher who call me crash a name i acquire after drop a beaker

9,I have this fear. It causes my legs to shake. I break out in a cold sweat. I start jabbering to anyone who is nearby. As thoughts of certain death run through my mind  the world appears a precious  treasured place. I imagine my own funeral  then shrink back at the implications of where my thoughts are taking me. My stomach feels strange. My palms are clammy. I am terrified of heights. Of course  its not really a fear of being in a high place. Rather  it is the view of a long way to fall  of rocks far below me and no firm wall between me and the edge. My sense of security is screamingly absent. There are no guardrails  flimsy though I picture them  or other safety devices. I can rely only on my own surefootednessâ€”or lack thereof. Despite my fear  two summers ago I somehow found myself climbing to a high place  while quaking inside and out. Most of our high school had come along on a day trip to the BoquerÃ³n  a gorgeous  lush spot in the foothills of Peru. Its prime attraction is the main waterfall  about 100 feet high  that thunders into a crystal clear pool feeding the Aguaytia River. All around the pool and on down to the rushing river are boulders large and small. The beach is strewn with rocks. On both sides of the fall  the jungle stretches to meet it  rising parallel to it on a gentler slope. After eating our sack lunches within sight and sound of the fall  many of us wanted to make the climb to an area above it. We knew others had done so on previous trips. A few guys went first to make sure they were on the right path. But after they left  my group of seven decided to go ahead without waiting for them to return. I suspected we were going the wrong way  but I kept silent  figuring that the others knew better. We went along the base of the hill until we reached the climb. It stopped me in my tracks. The climb ascended steeply above us. Along the right edge  the jungle hugged the rocks; passage through its trees did not look feasible. The majority of my view was filled with rocks. Looming high to the sky  the boulders rose in a tiered manner. Peering back down toward the river  I saw a steep slope of rocks all the way to the water. All I could think about was how far it would be to fall. My tense thoughts were interrupted by the realization that my friends were already beginning to climb! My anxiety increased as I watched them. Do I turn back? My whole being shouted  Yes! Will I regret it later? I really want to get to the top  butâ€¦ I voiced my uncertainties to my friends. They dismissed my fears and encouraged me to stick it out. Questioning my own sanity  I decided at least to attempt the climb. I chose a path that seemed easiest. My friend Tom was ahead of me. Then  suddenly  he slipped and slid backward about 10 feet! I watched  paralyzed  until he stopped himself and assured us he was all right. My heart was hammering. Now those who had tried the other way came back; it had not worked. Consoling myself that my friend Seth would be right behind me  I shakily began the ascent. The path led up a narrow area between boulders. In it  we reached a place where there just were no good handholds. Seth braced my foot  and those above sent down words of encouragement. I was soon past the first challenge safely  but not feeling much better about the rest of the climb. The difficulties only increased from that point on  with scary spot after scary spot. Though I knew I should not look down  I could not always ignore the long drop to the boulders below. My breathing sped up  but my heart pounded even faster  growing loud in my ears. My friends kept right on climbing. But they did not forget me. Someone was always behind me to help hold my feet steady when necessary  and someone else was always ahead to offer a hand up. I trusted them more than myself; I knew my feet could easily slip. With friends supporting me by words and actions  I slowly gained ground. Finally we came to the worst section yet. To me the slope looked very close to vertical. The slight handholds were few and far between. Being short  I knew the stretches would be difficult enough in normal conditions. In my current panic  it would be much worse. The alternative was to go back down. Which was more difficult? I didnt want to go either way  but obviously I had to go somewhere. The trouble was  we were not getting any nearer to the falls. By now  we realized that this route was not the way most frequented! But knowing this did not get me any closer to safety. Since getting up this next part was next to impossible  and waiting for a rescue helicopter was not an option  with fear and trembling I decided to go down  but not by myself. Melody agreed to go with me  earning my eternal gratitude. She paused to pray for safety; I did not trust my voice enough to pray aloud. Now  with our backs to the rocks  the drop was continually in our line of vision. It seemed even steeper than before. The song Angels Watching Over Me ran through my head as we began  Melody going first. I kept up a steady stream of chatter  my trembling voice betraying my fear. One of the first tough places we came to gave us trouble. Cautiously stretching one foot down  Melody could not reach the bottom of the boulder. A slip would mean an extremely long drop. So we tried a different route where a fall would be shorter. It was somewhat wet and would entail a short slide to reach the bottom. Melody made it safely. I hesitated  unsure of my footing  and picturing myself at the bottom of the cliff  bones broken and pain wracking my body  if I still lived. You can do it! Im right here  Melody called. She waited patiently  not pressuring me to hurry. Inching carefully to the edge  I could see in the corner of my eye the boulders and river far below. As I started down the rock  my foot slipped! My heart jumped into my throat as the terror I had held just under the surface swept over me. Im gonna fall! I inwardly shrieked. It had been only a small slip  however; I was not in midair! I took a few calming breaths  and my heart repositioned itself where it belonged. With no further mishaps  we came eventually to the last troublesome spot  the stretch between two boulders that had given me problems on the way up. Thankfully  the rest of our friends had given up climbing to the top and had now caught up to us. There were two possible descents from here. One way included a short jump down. I decided to check out the other way. Seth was working his way down this second route when he fell a few feet and bruised himself! I again looked over the first option. Do I want to jump? Theres a big drop if I jump wrong or dont stop on the ledge! But the other wayâ€¦! I knew if I was to get down  it would have to be Seths way. He was willing to help me however he could. I inspected the path he had taken. There was some low vegetation  matted down and sloping slightly toward the edge. Then came a drop down to a narrow inlet between rocks. That was not so bad. The hitch lay in the fact that there was no handholds or footholds  and my short legs would not reach to the rocks. Uh  I dont know about this. I dont like the looks of it! I said  my voice quavering. You can make it  Amy! Im right here. I wont let you fall  Seth promised. Slowly  painstakingly  I backed over the vegetation. Im coming down  I warned  my voice unsteady. Im ready  answered Seth. I got you. His assurances gave me the strength to go on. I trusted him implicitly. Flattening myself onto my belly  I edged my feet into midair. Seth held them tightly and slowly lowered me  guiding my feel to a firm place as I let my body slide over the leaves  twigs  and rock. When my feet made contact with the solid rock  I heaved a huge sigh of relief. I could feel the fear draining out of me. My arms and legs were scratched up; I was dirty and sweaty. But none of it mattered. I was at the bottom! Yaaaaaaahhhh! I yelled. I never felt so alive  and so thankful for that life.,i have this fear it cause my leg to shake i break out in a cold sweat i start jabber to anyone who be nearby a thought of certain death run

I suspected we were going the wrong way but I kept silent figuring that the others knew better . + we went along the base of the hill until we reached the climb . + it stopped me in my tracks . + the climb ascended steeply above us . + along the right edge the jungle hugged the rocks ; passage through its trees did not look feasible . + the majority of my view was filled with rocks . + looming high to the sky the boulders rose in a tiered manner . + peering back down toward the river I saw a steep slope of rocks all the way to the water . + all I could think about was how far it would be to fall . + my tense thoughts were interrupted by the realization that my friends were already beginning to climb ! + my anxiety increased as I watched them . + do I turn back ? + my whole being shouted + yes ! + will I regret it later ? I really want to get to the top but I voiced my uncertainties to my friends . + they dismissed my fears and encouraged me to stick it out . + questioning my own sanity I decided at least to attempt the climb . I chose a path that seemed easiest . + my friend + tom was ahead of me . + then suddenly he slipped and slid backward about 10 feet ! I watched paralyzed until he stopped himself and assured us he was all right . + my heart was hammering . + now those who had tried the other way came back ; it had not worked . + consoling myself that my friend + seth would be right behind me I shakily began the ascent . + the path led up a narrow area between boulders . + in it we reached a place where there just were no good handholds . + seth braced my foot and those above sent down words of encouragement . I was soon past the first challenge safely but not feeling much better about the rest of the climb . + the difficulties only increased from that point on with scary spot after scary spot . + though I knew I should not look down I could not always ignore the long drop to the boulders below . + my breathing sped up but my heart pounded even faster growing loud in my ears . + my friends kept right on climbing . + but they did not forget me . + someone was always behind me to help hold my feet steady when necessary and someone else was always ahead to offer a hand up . I trusted them more than myself ; I knew my feet could easily slip . + with friends supporting me by words and actions I slowly gained ground . + finally we came to the worst section yet . + to me the slope looked very close to vertical . + the slight handholds were few and far between . + being short I knew the stretches would be difficult enough in normal conditions . + in my current panic it would be much worse . + the alternative was to go back down . + which was more difficult ? I didnt want to go either way but obviously I had to go somewhere . + the trouble was we were not getting any nearer to the falls . + by now we realized that this route was not the way most frequented ! + but knowing this did not get me any closer to safety . + since getting up this next part was next to impossible and waiting for a rescue helicopter was not an option with fear and trembling I decided to go down but not by myself . + melody agreed to go with me earning my eternal gratitude . + she paused to pray for safety ; I did not trust my voice enough to pray aloud . + now with our backs to the rocks the drop was continually in our line of vision . + it seemed even steeper than before . + the song + angels + watching + over + me ran through my head as we began + melody going first . I kept up a steady stream of chatter my trembling voice betraying my fear . + one of the first tough places we came to gave us trouble . + cautiously stretching one foot down + melody could not reach the bottom of the boulder . A slip would mean an extremely long drop . + so we tried a different route where a fall would be shorter . + it was somewhat wet and would entail a short slide to reach the bottom . + melody made it safely . I hesitated unsure of my footing and picturing myself at the bottom of the cliff bones broken and pain wracking my body if I still lived . + you can do it ! + im right here + melody called . + she waited patiently not pressuring me to hurry . + inching carefully to the edge I could see in the corner of my eye the boulders and river far below . + as I started down the rock my foot slipped ! + my heart jumped into my throat as the terror I had held just under the surface swept over me . + im gonna fall ! I inwardly shrieked . + it had been only a small slip however ; I was not in midair ! I took a few calming breaths and my heart repositioned itself where it belonged . + with no further mishaps we came eventually to the last troublesome spot the stretch between two boulders that had given me problems on the way up . + thankfully the rest of our friends had given up climbing to the top and had now caught up to us . + there were two possible descents from here . + one way included a short jump down . I decided to check out the other way . + seth was working his way down this second route when he fell a few feet and bruised himself ! I again looked over the first option . + do I want to jump ? + theres a big drop if I jump wrong or dont stop on the ledge ! + but the other way ! I knew if I was to get down it would have to be + seths way . + he was willing to help me however he could . I inspected the path he had taken . + there was some low vegetation matted down and sloping slightly toward the edge . + then came a drop down to a narrow inlet between rocks . + that was not so bad . + the hitch lay in the fact that there was no handholds or footholds and my short legs would not reach to the rocks . + uh I dont know about this . I dont like the looks of it ! I said my voice quavering . + you can make it + amy ! + im right here . I wont let you fall + seth promised . + slowly painstakingly I backed over the vegetation . + im coming down I warned my voice unsteady . + im ready answered + seth . I got you . + his assurances gave me the strength to go on . I trusted him implicitly . + flattening myself onto my belly I edged my feet into midair . + seth held them tightly and slowly lowered me guiding my feel to a firm place as I let my body slide over the leaves twigs and rock . + when my feet made contact with the solid rock I heaved a huge sigh of relief . I could feel the fear draining out of me . + my arms and legs were scratched up ; I was dirty and sweaty . + but none of it mattered . I was at the bottom ! + yaaaaaaahhhh ! I yelled . I never felt so alive and so thankful for that life . 
9,I have lived in three places in my entire life. The first home I remember living in was mis abuelos house. I lived in the upper flat of their duplex until I was three years old. My brother was fifteen years old  and my sister was six years old. I am the youngest in my small family. We moved out of that house because mi abuela and my mother were not getting along very well. They argued constantly  screaming so loudly that the neighbors windows started to shake. When we left  we only moved 20 blocks away. We moved into another duplex  but this time we stayed for one year. I saw a mouse rolling a ball of yarn through my room. We moved to Medford Avenue when I was six years old. I vividly remember stepping out of our old Ford Taurus that was on the verge of dying at any moment and looking at my dream home in awe. It was beautiful like a flower just coming into bloom. I saw my Grandmother Vivian walk out of the amazing setting. It was another duplex. My new home was in the upper flat. My dreams slowly started to fade away like the steam floating off a cup of hot coffee. I was living with my grandmother  whom I had never really spoken to. I knew that I wasnt going to be happy there. I discovered that that was an understatement. My Niece Is Born! My brother is exactly 11 years and 9 months older than me. He met my sister-in-law when I was about three years old. I have known her basically my whole life. My brother and my sister-in-law got married  and all of a sudden I had a new sister. Little did I know that just a short time later I would have a niece. My brother told me the terrific news when I was only ten years of age. I was going to be an aunt. I spent eight grueling months preparing for the responsibility. I had a plan in my head about how great it was going to be. She was going to dress like me  and we were going to hang out at the mall together. Then she was born  and all of my plans were gone. She was only a baby. The diapers  the vomit  the crying were all grating. A jackhammer of a headache banged in my head. How was I supposed to watch her and play video games at the same time? Too much responsibility for me. I was as cold as ice to her. I would not pick her up  and I would not change her diapers. I felt like a lump of coal. I decided to make it up to her when she was old enough to walk. I would take her everywhere with me  and I did. She is now my best friend  even though she is only five years old. I wouldnt trade her for anything. The Day My Grandmother Died . . . Or Maybe Four Days Later My grandmother was sick for a long time. She lost her memory so gradually that it was like sand in an hourglass slowly slipping away. I cant remember when she actually got sick  but I knew that I would have to grow up very quickly. We took care of her for a while  and then we had to admit her into a nursing home. I went to see her two days before my trip to Washington  D.C. She did not know who I was  but she just smiled at me like she always did. They said that she was fine  that she was in perfect health. We left  and I went home to prepare for my trip. She died six days later. It was the day after my return home. We did not find out until about four days later. Something was odd about that day. My mom picked me up early from school  and she looked very sad. In a joking way  I asked  Who died? I did not know that someone did. My mom took me to work  and I spent two hours trying to figure out what was wrong. My mom came in with an umbrella and asked me if I could walk home. Tears were in her eyes  and they looked as if they were going to explode like a dam overflowing with water. I said  Sure  and I started walking home. When I got home  my mom and dad told me to sit down in the living room. My dad said that Grandmother had expired. I couldnt speak. All of my words were stolen. I cried endlessly  like a waterfall after the rain. I cant remember much of that day. I remember calling my friend Chris and telling him that I was going to be okay. Then everything blacked out like the darkness of space and time. My First Boyfriend . . . Sort Of It all started on the first day of my horrible high school career. I remember walking through that big school on the gray  evil morning. I walked to my resource room and sat down right next to the guy who would turn my world upside down. I remember looking toward the window and seeing his spiking hair outline against the dreary horizon. He was looking at me. I knew that he must have been looking at a girl behind me or something. He couldnt possibly be looking at me. Boy  was I wrong. Fast forward to our first school dance. It was the weirdest dance I have ever been to. I knew only one person at the school  and she did not even show up. I walked into the loud  dark  cave-like room. I noticed his spiky hair and I decided to ask him if he saw a mutual friend of ours. I walked up to him quickly  avoiding any eye contact. Have you seen Ashlie? Huh? I said have you seen Ashlie! Huh?! His friend pushed his head into mine. I looked at him quickly and ran away with the speed of lightning. All night long his friends pushed him toward me. A random girl came up to me and snatched my hand like it was a purse full of new bills. She pulled me toward him and made us exchange phone numbers. That wasnt the end. The invention of the dreaded Crush can made all of it worse. He sent a Crush can to me. Now  this was a curse. Many girls liked him  and they practically threw themselves at him. Basically every girl in my phy ed class hated me. He sent me the highest Crush can there isâ€”red . . . the color of fire . . . the color of love. After that everything was great . . . sort of. He sent me three balloons on my birthday. He acts like he is my boyfriend  but the problem is . . . he has never asked me out! My Best Friend(s) I have three best friends  and they are all very different. They have different tastes and personalities. They are all special in their own ways. My friend Megan is the strangest but the coolest person I know. She always finds ways to make me laugh  and she is always there for support. We have known each other since sixth grade  but we became best friends during the eighth grade. She helped me through a bunch of problems. I go to her with all of my guy problems . . . including the most recent problems. Without her  I would be lost. My friend Catherine is the total opposite of Megan  but she is still as cool as a cucumber. She is Mormon  and she really believes in her religion. I respect her for that. She is always there when I need a shoulder to cry on. She is extremely nice  and she is as sweet as sugar. She is really cool to hang out with at the mall because we both have the same style in clothing. I have only known her for a year  but I feel like I have known her forever. My friend Chris is my protector. He is like a big brother (but I am older than he is). He will intimidate anyone who decides to mess with me. I can talk to him about anything (and he doesnt like most of it)  and he will give the guys opinion on everything. Hes great to just hang with on a Saturday and play football or soccer with. Without these people I would not have a home. Sure  I have shelter and a roof over my head  but that doesnt make a home. My home is happiness and love. It is caring and sharing. It is dealing with the good times and the bad. Home is with the people I love.

9,Something happens inside of me when I listen to the music of the Counting Crows. Raw  uncensored emotion pours from the mouth of lead singer Adam Duritz. His voice seems to naturally synthesize with the background music of guitars  pianos  organs  drums  and accordions. When Adam sings  its as if hes ripped open his chest and is exposing his heart and all of its contents  regardless of the cost  because thats how much his emotions mean to him. The words of Adams self-written songs (lyrics and piano music) can speak to anybody and convey a vivid mental picture of the mood present in the music. The bands music and Adams lyrics are best described in the following quote: Take autumn  with all its leaves falling off of the trees  and the green turning to gold . . . and then the sodden brown of winter  the coming chill in the air  the sudden clarity of the moon at night  the aching melancholy felt as summer rolls away behind you  and the world of winter wraps itself around you. If you could take all of this  and all that it means and suggests  and turn it into music  you would have the Counting Crows. Adam Duritz was born in Baltimore  Maryland  but lived in Boston  Denver  and Dallas before settling down with his family in San Francisco. Before leading the Crows  Adam was an English major at the University of California at Davis and at Berkeley in the late 80s. He quit school without turning in his thesis because he thought that it wasnt very good. Between the time he dropped out of school and formed the band  Adam worked a wide array of jobs  getting fired from each one. An insomniac  Adam has had plenty of idle time to be productive. He claims that his inability to sleep is due to his uneasiness about letting go of consciousness. He says he cant allow himself to do it. During sleepless nights  Adams true poetic genius takes over. He just lets himself go  pouring onto paper thoughts about his past relationships and other memories. Any avid listener will notice that a few recurring metaphors are present in Adams songs: that memories are ghosts and relationships are trains. The first of these two metaphors is pretty self-explanatory; however  the second needs some explanation. Adam believes that getting into a relationship is similar to boarding a train and riding to a final destination with the other person. He feels that in order to be in a relationship  one must be willing and able to live with the other persons ghosts. Its quite a beautiful concept about the trains. In his song Ghost Train  Adam sings  Love is like a ghost train rumbling through the darkness. Remember everything when only memory remains. Another characteristic that an avid Crows listener will notice is that Adam often sings about particular women. Theres Maria  Elizabeth  Amy  Anna  Shannon  Amanda  Lisa  and Margery  just to name a few. The two who appear most frequently in Adams lyrics are Maria and Elizabeth. Adam has said in interviews that Maria is like the female version of himself. He uses this fictional character in his songs when he wants to express his thoughts but not make it apparent that the song is about him. (However  he has said that most of his songs are about him or his experiences because thats all he knows.) Elizabeth is an ex-girlfriend of Adams. They were a couple when the Crows caught their first true glimpse of fame. Elizabeth was in college at the time that Adam was on the road touring. She was obsessed with the fear that Adam was cheating on her (which he claims he wasnt). As in most cases  the long-distance relationship didnt work out. Adam comments that the breakup was for the best; however  his songs including Elizabeth indicate otherwise. The song I Wish I Was a Girl on the album This Desert Life is about Adams desire to make Elizabeth realize that he was faithful to her during the time that he was away. Theres a double standard when girls say that they were faithful and theyre generally believed  but when guys say it  nobody believes them. Another song  Goodnight Elizabeth  from the album Recovering the Satellites is Adams lullaby dedicated to Elizabeth. The lyrics basically express that Adam will always carry a piece of Elizabeth with him. The lyrics say  I wish you were inside of me/I hope that youre OK/I hope youre resting quietly/I just wanted to say/Goodnight  Elizabeth  goodnight. He refers to himself as the king of the rain in a few songs  much like Jim Morrison is also known as the Lizard King. Ive tried to figure out what this rain symbolism means  and my hypothesis is that rain could mean tears or just a bad situation. Possibly he feels that he inadvertently causes a lot of problems for the people he cares about. As he sings in the song Chelsea  The things I do to people I love just shouldnt be allowed. He is quite absorbed in his own feelings  which is sometimes interpreted as egotism  but I get the impression that hes unsure of his true identity and doesnt really believe in himself. Since he is very sensitive and constantly searching his soul  hes become infatuated with his own feelings. Hes absorbed in feelings  and I think that people have interpreted that infatuation as egotism. Adams poetic lyrics move me to the depths of my soul. With just a few words and the emotion in his voice  he can make me feel as if there is a starry summer night inside of me . . . or a lonely  empty hotel room. There is nostalgia behind his lyrics and a canvas painted with love  loneliness  devotion  and disappointment. During the production of the bands first album  Adams most important goal was to make a mark upon the world. If its worth anything  hes made more than just a mark upon my world; he has painted me a sky and filled it with stars.,something happen inside of me when i listen to the music of the counting crow raw uncensored emotion pours from the mouth of lead singer adam duritz his voice seem to naturally synthesize with the background music of guitar pianos organ drum and accordion when adam sing it a if he rip open his chest and be expose his heart and all of it content regardless of the cost because thats how much his emotion mean to him the word of adam self write song lyric and piano music can speak to anybody and convey a vivid mental picture of the mood present in the music the band music and adams lyric be best describe in the following quote take autumn with all it leaf fall off of the tree and the green turning to gold and then the sodden brown of winter the come chill in the air the sudden clarity of the moon at night the ache melancholy felt a summer roll away behind you and the world of winter wrap itself around you if you could take all of this and all that it mean and suggest and turn it into music you would have the counting crow adam duritz be bear in baltimore maryland but live in boston denver and dallas before settle down with his family in san francisco before lead the crow adam be an english major at the university of california at davis and at berkeley in the late s he quit school without turn in his thesis because he think that it wasnt very good between the time he drop out of school and form the band adam work a wide array of job get fire from each one an insomniac adam have have plenty of idle time to be productive he claim that his inability to sleep be due to his uneasiness about let go of consciousness he say he cant allow himself to do it during sleepless night adams true poetic genius take over he just let himself go pour onto paper thought about his past relationship and other memory any avid listener will notice that a few recurring metaphor be present in adams song that memory be ghost and relationship be train the first of these two metaphor be pretty self explanatory however the second need some explanation adam believe that get into a relationship be similar to board a train and rid to a final destination with the other person he feel that in order to be in a relationship one must be willing and able to live with the other person ghost it quite a beautiful concept about the train in his song ghost train adam sings love be like a ghost train rumble through the darkness remember everything when only memory remain another characteristic that an avid crow listener will notice be that adam often sing about particular woman theres maria elizabeth amy anna shannon amanda lisa and margery just to name a few the two who appear most frequently in adams lyric be maria and elizabeth adam have say in interview that maria be like the female version of himself he use this fictional character in his song when he want to express his thought but not make it apparent that the song be about him however he have say that most of his song be about him or his experience because thats all he know elizabeth be an ex girlfriend of adam they be a couple when the crow catch their first true glimpse of fame elizabeth be in college at the time that adam be on the road tour she be obsess with the fear that adam be cheat on her which he claim he wasnt a in most case the long distance relationship didnt work out adam comment that the breakup be for the best however his song include elizabeth indicate otherwise the song i wish i be a girl on the album this desert life be about adam desire to make elizabeth realize that he be faithful to her during the time that he be away theres a double standard when girl say that they be faithful and theyre generally believe but when guy say it nobody believe them another song goodnight elizabeth from the album recover the satellite be adams lullaby dedicate to elizabeth the lyric

elizabeth goodnight he refer to himself a the king of the rain in a few song much like jim morrison be also know a the lizard king ive try to figure out what this rain symbolism mean and my hypothesis be that rain could mean tear or just a bad situation possibly he feel that he inadvertently cause a lot of problem for the people he care about a he sing in the song chelsea the thing i do to people i love just shouldnt be allow he be quite absorb in his own feeling which be sometimes interpret a egotism but i get the impression that hes unsure of his true identity and doesnt really believe in himself since he be very sensitive and constantly search his soul hes become infatuated with his own feeling he absorb in feeling and i think that people have interpret that infatuation a egotism adam poetic lyric move me to the depth of my soul with just a few word and the emotion in his voice he can make me feel a if there be a starry summer night inside of me or a lonely empty hotel room there

9,How can I go on living? My one and only child was taken away from me tonight. It started out as a calm and normal night. It never occurred to me that in only a few short hours I would lose my child  my world  my life. I had this feeling in the pit of my stomach. I knew something was going to happen. I do not know why I sent my child outside. But as soon as he left  I heard horses. It sounded as if they had hit something. I ran out of the house as quickly as possible  but I was too late. My child was on the road  bleeding from the head. I ran to my childs side. I tried to revive him. I called out his name  but I knew that he could not hear me. He was gone. I screamed that he was dead  that he had been killed. I tried to get someone to help  but the only person who spoke was the man in the carriage. His name was Monsieur the Marquis  and I will die despising that name. He had no sympathy at all. My child was beneath his carriage  and he told me that I did not know how to care for my children. I stood there staring at him  trying to figure out what was wrong with him. He threw a gold coin at me and asked me my name. Of course  I told him. I said something about my childs death  and he smiled. He asked me if I was a philosopher. Why would anyone ask a question like that at a time like this? I said yes  and he asked me my profession. I told him that I was a vendor of wine. He threw another gold coin at me and told me to buy something at will. Two gold coins were supposed to make up for the loss of my son. I was enraged and threw the coins back into his carriage. I fell to my knees and started sobbing. I did not know what else to do. He stuck his head back out of the carriage and yelled as if he were insulted. I just want to know how I can go on living without the one thing that mattered most to me. It will be extremely hard  and I do not think I will ever actually get over it. How can one get over such a thing? I do not know what to do. I do not know how to live.

9,Children  as they become adults  become more appreciative of their parents. In The Joy Luck Club  the attitudes of four daughters toward their mothers change as the girls mature and come to realize that their mothers arent so different after all. As children  the daughters in this book are ashamed of their mothers and dont take them very seriously  dismissing them as quirky and odd. I could never tell my father . . . How could I tell him my mother was crazy? (p. 117). They dont try to comprehend their culture  which is a big part of understanding their traditional Chinese mothers. On page 6  one of the daughters states  I can never remember things I dont understand in the first place  referring to Chinese expressions her mother used. When their mothers show pride in them  the girls only show their embarrassment. One daughter shows her shame when she says to her mother  I wish you wouldnt do that  telling everyone Im your daughter (p. 101). The girls cannot relate to their mothers because they were raised in a different world. No matter how much the mothers care for them or how much they sacrifice to make their girls lives better  the daughters are blind to their mothers pain and feelings. All four of the Joy Luck mothers need their daughters to understand them  pass on their spirit after they are gone  and understand what they have gone through for their girls. One mother dreams of doing this on her trip to a new life: In America I will have a daughter just like me . . . over there nobody will look down on her . . . and she will always be too full to swallow any sorrow! She will know my meaning because I will give her this swan . . . it carries with it all my good intentions (pp. 3-4). Another mother plans how she will give her daughter this perception: She [my daughter] has no chi . . . How can I leave the world without leaving her my spirit? So this is what I will do. I will gather together my past and . . . see a thing that has already happened. The pain that cut my spirit loose. I will hold that pain in my hand until it becomes hard and shiny  more clear. And then my fierceness can come back . . . I will use this sharp pain to penetrate my daughters tough skin and cut her tiger spirit loose. She will fight me  because this is the nature of two tigers. But I will win and give her my spirit because this is why a mother loves a daughter. (p. 286) Things dont exactly turn out the way the mothers hope  though. Their hopes and dreams are shattered when they realize their daughters misconceptions of them. On page 282  a mother laments  When my daughter looks at me  she sees a small  old lady. If she had chuming [inside knowledge of things] she would see a tiger lady. One daughter sees the fear of the remaining mothers after she tells them that she doesnt know anything about her dead mother that she can pass on: They are frightened. In me  they see their own daughters  just as ignorant  just as unmindful of all the truths and hopes they have brought to America. They see daughters who grow impatient when their mothers talk in Chinese  who think they are stupid when they explain things in fractured English . . . They see daughters who will bear grandchildren born without any connecting hope passed from generation to generation. (p. 31)  This fear does not persist  however. As the daughters mature  the two generations discover that they arent so different after all. One mother says  She puts her face next to mine  side by side  and we look at each other in the mirror . . . these two faces  I think  so much the same! The same happiness  the same sadness  the same good fortune  the same faults (p. 292). One daughter  after her mothers death  sits down to play the piano that she had refused to touch before to defy her mother. Amy Tan uses the metaphor of two piano pieces to compare the mother to this daughter: The piece I had played for the recital . . . was on the left-hand side of the page . . . and for the first time . . . I noticed the piece on the right-hand side . . . It had a lighter melody but the same flowing rhythm [as the recital piece and] . . . was longer but faster. And after I played them both . . . I realized they were two halves of the same song (p. 155). The daughters  as they grow to be adults  become more appreciative of their mothers. Their attitudes change over time to create an understanding and respect that hadnt been there before: I saw what I had been fighting for. It was for me  a scared child  who had run away a long time ago to what I had imagined was a safer place. And hiding in this place  behind my invisible barriers  I knew what lay on the other side: her side attacks. Her secret weapons. Her uncanny ability to find my weakest spots. But in the brief instant that I had peered over the barriers I could finally see what was really there: an old woman  a wok for her armor  a knitting needle for her sword  getting a little crabby as she waited patiently for her daughter to invite her in. (pp. 203-204) In conclusion  as children  the daughters didnt understand their mothers or their culture. The daughters were being raised in a different world. Their perceptions of their mothers changed  though  as they grew up and realized that they werent so different from them after all. They finally understood and respected their traditional Chinese mothers.,child a they become adults become more appreciative of their parent in the joy luck club the attitude of four daughter toward

I cant even run. That takes me out for the rest of cross-country season! Beth: Its even on video! Lena: Where? Weasel: The police have it. Oh  fine  Ill narrate it again. I was driving down Crest Street in my dads van . . . Beth: When was this? Weasel: Yesterday. I had a key on the dashboard  and it slid off when I went around a corner. I was looking for it when I  uh  hit a telephone pole. Lena: (laughing) Why would you . . . Weasel: Then the pole rolled off the windshield and into the street  causing the electrical wires to droop down over the road. I was fine  though. I was wearing my seat belt  and the air bag went off. The electric company came. The cops were there. And then a semitrailer truck came down the street and ran into the wires  which pulled the telephone pole  which hit me and Officer Packard. Lena: It hit a police officer? Weasel: Yeah  but I was the one who did a back flip through the air  got knocked out  and landed on my knee. I woke up as they were putting me in the ambulance. Lena: Im trying not to laugh  really. Wait  how did it get on tape? Beth: The camera on the police cars dashboard was on. Lena: Have you seen it? Weasel: No. My parents and I are going to go see it this week. Bryon: Youll probably get to watch it again in court  too. Weasel: Oh  man. You know what  Bryon? You can just shutâ€” Mr. Pulaski: O.K. Were all here  so we can begin now. Beth: Where are Danielle and Troy? Bryon: Theyre in Mexico on some school trip. Lena: (to Weasel) So you cant run at all? Weasel: No  so there goes the teams chance of winning conference again this year. Lena: How about the van? Weasel: Totaled. Lena: Any kittens killed while you were at it? (Weasel gives her a dirty look.) Just kidding!Weasel: No  no kittens involved. But when the wires snapped  they tore the chimney off a house across the street. Lena: Now youre just giving me a hard time. Mr. Pulaski: No  that did happen. People  we need a newspaper here. (Bryon raises his hand.) Yes  Bryon? Bryon: A newspaper would be great  but first we need some stories. Mr. Pulaski: Yes  at our last meeting we discussed step one of journalism: find a story. Im glad you remembered that. Does anyone have any possible stories to cover? (silence) We do have a deadline. Lena: When? Mr. Pulaski: Three weeks. Lena: Hey  Weasel  doesnt Principal Jones live on Crest Street? Weasel: Yes. Lena: Isnt his the only house on Crest Street? Weasel: (sighing) Yes. Mr. Pulaski: So no one has any stories? Weasel: (getting up on his crutches to leave) Mr. Pulaski  you could give us three months and not much would happen in this school. But we do have three weeks  so how about we all try to find something to cover by our next meeting. (He exits.) Bryon: Right. We need more time to find newsworthy topics. See ya  Mr. P.  Ms. Cebon. (He exits.) Beth: I would look for stories now  but Senator Menlan is speaking to the student council at three oclock. (She exits.) Lena: Dont worry  Mr. Pulaski. Ill dig up some stories for you after I go to the airport to greet our foreign exchange student from Swaziland. (She exits.) Ms. Cebon: How long will it take them to figure it out?

9,At their Web site  students from Lincoln Bassett Community School answer the question Who is Rosa Parks? I think Rosa Parks was a woman who stood up for what she believed in. â€”Brittney Hammett  She was a woman who had the guts to stand up for what she believed. â€”Jessie Alexander  Several other students also answered the question  responding with phrases like my hero and queen mother of the revolution. Rosa Parks is often considered as just these things  remembered as the tired seamstress who refused to give up a bus seat to a white man in 1955. Parks  however  wasâ€”and still isâ€”much more than that. Rosa Louise McCauley was born on February 4 1913  in Tuskeegee  Alabama  to her parents  Leona  a teacher  and James  a carpenter. At the age of 2  she moved to Pine Level  Alabama  with her mother and younger brother  Sylvester  to live on her grandparents farm. At age 11  she began education at the Montgomery Industrial School for Girls  a private school founded by women from the northern United States  and then went on to the Alabama State Teachers College. With her husband  Raymond Parks  she settled in Montgomery and joined the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). She served as secretary of the NAACP and later as advisor to the NAACP Youth Council. Several times Parks tried to register to vote. These activities made the bus incident seem more than just a local ordinance violation. On Thursday  December 1 1955  43-year-old Parks boarded a city bus for the ride home after work (she was a seamstress at the time). Following the local ordinance that segregated blacks and whites  she sat in the fifth row of the bus  the closest colored row to the front  along with three other black people. The first four rows of the bus filled after a few stops  and one white man was left standing. The bus driver  James F. Blake  told the four in the fifth row to move. Three did  but Parks refused. The ordinance forbade blacks and whites from sitting next to one another on buses  and the driver said that if she did not move  he would call the police to have her arrested. Parks may have been tired after a day at work  but she was exhausted by the way African Americans were being treated. Parks was not the first person arrested for violating the ordinance  but she was the first well-known person in the Montgomery African American community to be arrested for it  setting off a chain of events that changed American history. Leaders in the Montgomery area  including Martin Luther King  Jr.  Rev. Ralph Abernathy  and Jo Ann Robinson (head of the Womens Political Council)  feeling that some sort of protest was needed  held a meeting that weekend to organize the Montgomery Bus Boycott. On Monday evening  another meeting was held  and everyone voted to continue the boycott. From December 5 1955  to December 20 1956  90 percent of the blacks who normally rode buses in Montgomery participated in the boycott. Parks arrest led not only to the Montgomery Bus Boycott  but also to headlines for the NAACP and the civil rights movement and national recognition of leaders such as King. Literally and  perhaps  ironically  Parks had refused to stand up for what she believed in; and by remaining seated  she went beyond taking a stand. Her case went all the way to the Supreme Court  and on November 13 1956  racial segregation on public transportation was declared unconstitutional. In 1957  Parks and her husband moved to Detroit and founded the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development  offering guidance to young African Americans in leadership and careers. In 1994  Rosa Parks was attacked in her home by a man wanting money from her. Parks  with the quiet faith and determination she showed the world in 1955  says she prays for him. According to writer Kira Albin  Parks belief in God and her religious convictions are at the core of everything she does. Parks book  Quiet Strength  spreads this message. In an interview  she gave these recommendations: The advice I would give to young people is  first of all  to rid themselves of prejudice against other people and to be concerned about what they can do to help others  and  of course  to get a good education and to take advantage of the opportunities they have. Rosa Parks said  I think the American Dream should be to have a good life and to live well and to be a good citizen; I think that should apply to all of us. She stands out in American history as a person who  in the course of a regular day  found the opportunity to stay seated for what she believed in and to educate and help others to understand this belief.,at their web site student from lincoln bassett community school answer the question who be rosa park i think rosa park be a woman who stand up for what she believe in brittney hammett she be a woman who have the gut to stand up for what she believe jessie alexander several other student also answer the question respond with phrase like my hero and queen mother of the revolution rosa park be often consider a just these thing remember a the tired seamstress who refuse to give up a bus seat to a white man in park however be and still be much more than that rosa louise mccauley be bear on february in tuskeegee alabama to her parent leona a teacher and jam a carpenter at the age of she move to pine level alabama with her mother and young brother sylvester to live on her grandparent farm at age she begin education at the montgomery industrial school for girl a private school found by woman from the northern united state and then go on to the alabama state teacher college with her husband raymond park she settle in montgomery and join the local chapter of the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp she serve a secretary of the naacp and later a advisor to the naacp youth council several time park try to register to vote these activity make the bus incident seem more than just a local ordinance violation on thursday december year old park board a city bus for the ride home after work she be a seamstress at the time follow the local ordinance that segregate black and white she sit in the fifth row of the bus the close colored row to the front along with three other black people the first four row of the bus fill after a few stop and one white man be leave stand the bus driver james f blake tell the four in the fifth row to move three do but park refuse the ordinance forbade black and white from sit next to one another on bus and the driver say that if she do not move he would call the police to have her arrest park may have be tire after a day at work but she be exhaust by the way african american be be treat park be not the first person arrest for violate the ordinance but she be the first well know person in the montgomery african american community to be arrest for it set off a chain of event that change american history leader in the montgomery area include martin luther king jr rev ralph abernathy and jo ann robinson head of the woman political council feeling that some sort of protest be need hold a meeting that weekend to organize the montgomery bus boycott on monday even another meeting be hold and everyone vote to continue the boycott from december to december percent of the black who normally ride bus in montgomery participate in the boycott park arrest lead not only to the montgomery bus boycott but also to headline for the naacp and the civil right movement and national recognition of leader such a king literally and perhaps ironically park have refuse to stand up for what she believe in and by remain seat she go beyond take a stand her case go all the way to the supreme court and on november racial segregation on public transportation be declare unconstitutional in park and her husband move to detroit and found the rosa and raymond park institute for self development offer guidance to young african american in leadership and career in rosa park be attack in her home by a man want money from her park with the quiet faith and determination she show the world in say she pray for him accord to writer kira albin park belief in god and her religious conviction be at the core of everything she do park book quiet strength spread this message in an interview she give these recommendation the advice i would give to young people be first of all to rid themselves of prejudice against other people and to be concern about what they can do to help others and of course to get a good education and to take advantage of the opportunity they have rosa park say i think the american dream should be to have a good life and to live well and to be a good citizen i think that should apply to all of u she stand out in american history a a person who in the course of a regular day find the opportunity to stay seat for what she believe in and to educate and help others to understand this belief,+ at their + web site students from + lincoln + bassett + community + school answer the question + who is + rosa + parks ?

9,In the perfect situation  smoking policy would be set by bar or restaurant owners  and customers would patronize the establishments with the policy they prefer. Customers would decideâ€”without the governments helpâ€”if they want to avoid smoke-filled rooms or enter them. They might even choose to sit in an area sectioned off for smokers or non-smokers  but the ultimate issue is choice (Ruwart 1). When the government starts telling restaurant owners what their customers can and cannot do  the government is overstepping its boundaries. Our government aims to protect usâ€”to save us from societys evils. However  in an attempt to protect the public from the effects of passive smoking (second hand smoke)â€”of which  according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service in 1994  the statistical evidence does not . . . support a conclusion that there are substantive health effects . . . (Krauthammer)â€”the feds have failed to protect a vital part of the U.S. economic population: business owners. Many people who drink also tend to smoke; banning drinkers from smoking has hurt business in some bars and restaurants. According to the California Licensed Beverage Association  business has dropped as much as 85 percent . . . since the prohibition took effect (Bar Owners Vow 1). The decrease in customers and subsequent loss of revenue has far-reaching effects on employers. A study by the American Beverage Institute entitled Effect of 1998 California Smoking Ban on Bars  Taverns  and Night Clubs asked 300 respondents about the effects of the ban on their businesses. When asked if the ban caused owners to lay off employees or cut working hours  29.7 percent of respondents answered yes; 59 percent gave the same answer when asked if they experienced a loss of tips/gratuities for bar and serving-staff employees (1). The plight of restaurant and bar owners is often ignored  but it is a serious issue for them and for their employees. While the argument rages over the effects of smoking on public health  the question that remains is this: How much is society entitled to penalize smokers for their decisions becauseâ€”in societys viewâ€”those decisions are unhealthy? (Samuelson). Smoking tobacco is not an illegal act  yet the 25 percent of Americans who do smoke are often treated as if they were criminals. They are incessantly nagged  blamed for numerous illnesses and unpleasantries  and made to feel guilty by self-righteous nonsmokers (Bork 28). The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that living with a smoker increases your chance of lung cancer by 19 percent. What they fail to tell you is that  in contrast  (firsthand) smoking increases your chance 1 000 percent (Buckley). Why is the act of smoking tobacco  which merely injures oneself  so scrutinized and shunned by society  while drinking alcohol  which is by far more deadly to innocent bystanders  is accepted by society and virtually unregulated? (Krauthammer). One may not wish to be seated near an extremely obese person in a restaurant  but it would certainly be unconstitutional to deny service to these patrons. In modern society  the government knows better than to discriminate against minorities  senior citizens  or the physically handicapped; it does not hesitate  however  to discriminate against smokers. Personal choice is a simple principle that is highly valued in American society. Banning smoking in all public restaurants violates this principle and jeopardizes our freedom. Smoking should not be banned in all restaurants. A ban on smoking imposes unnecessary governmental interference in private business  affects business owners negatively  and discriminates against smokers. Like the black Southerner turned away because of racial segregation  the smoker is unfairly treated. Sadly  just when our government claims to be whisking away the clouds of smoke  it is legislating a cloud of discrimination.,in the perfect situation smoking policy would be set by bar or restaurant owner and customer would patronize the establishment with the policy they prefer customer would decide without the government help if they want to avoid smoke fill room or enter them they might even choose to sit in an area section off for smoker or non smoker but the ultimate issue be choice ruwart when the government start tell restaurant owner what their customer can and cannot do the government be overstep it boundary our government aim to protect u to save u from society evil however in an attempt to protect the public from the effect of passive smoking second hand smoke of which accord to the nonpartisan congressional research service in the statistical evidence do not support a conclusion that there be substantive health effect krauthammer the fed have fail to protect a vital part of the u s economic population business owner many people who drink also tend to smoke ban drinker from smoking have hurt business in some bar and restaurant accord to the california license beverage association business have drop as much a percent since the prohibition take effect bar owner vow the decrease in customer and subsequent loss of revenue have far reach effect on employer a study by the american beverage institute entitle effect of california smoking ban on bar tavern and night club ask respondent about the effect of the ban on their business when ask if the ban cause owner to lay off employee or cut working hour percent of respondent answered yes percent give the same answer when ask if they experience a loss of tip gratuity for bar and serve staff employee the plight of restaurant and bar owner be often ignore but it be a serious issue for them and for their employee while the argument rag over the effect of smoke on public health the question that remain be this how much be society entitle to penalize smoker for their decision because in societys view those decision be unhealthy samuelson smoking tobacco be not an illegal act yet the percent of american who do smoke be often treat a if they be criminal they be incessantly nag blame for numerous illness and unpleasantries and make to feel guilty by self righteous nonsmoker bork the environmental protection agency estimate that live with a smoker increase your chance of lung cancer by percent what they fail to tell you be that in contrast firsthand smoking increase your chance percent buckley why be the act of smoke tobacco which merely injure oneself so scrutinized and shun by society while drink alcohol which be by far more deadly to innocent bystander be accept by society and virtually unregulated krauthammer one may not wish to be seat near an extremely obese person in a restaurant but it would certainly be unconstitutional to deny service to these patron in modern society the government know good than to discriminate against minority senior citizen or the physically handicap it do not hesitate however to discriminate against smoker personal choice be a simple principle that be highly value in american society ban smoking in all public restaurant violate this principle and jeopardize our freedom smoking should not be ban in all restaurant a ban on smoking imposes unnecessary governmental interference in private business affect business owner negatively and discriminate against smoker like the black southerner turn away because of racial segregation the smoker be unfairly treat sadly just when our government claim to be whisk away the cloud of smoke it be legislate a cloud of discrimination,+ in the perfect situation smoking policy would be set by bar or restaurant owners and customers would patronize the establishments with the policy they prefer . + customers would decidewithout the governments helpif they want to avoid smoke - filled rooms or enter them . + they might even choose to sit in an area sectioned off for smokers or non - smokers but the ultimate issue is choice ( + ruwart 1 ) . + when the government starts telling restaurant owners what their customers can and cannot do the government is overstepping its boundaries . + our government aims to protect usto save us from societys evils . + however in an attempt to protect the public from the effects of passive smoking ( second hand smoke ) of which according to the nonpartisan + congressional + research + service in 1994 the statistical evidence does not . . . support a conclusion that there are substantive health effects . . .

9,The picture may seem familiar. Tumbling out of bed and stumbling around in the kitchenâ€”you begin your day. But wait. It cannot begin properly without that daily ritual  the morning cup of coffee. The aroma swirls throughout the room. What can compare to the richness and fullness of that first cup of coffee? Americans lead the world in coffee drinking  consuming an average of 3.4 cups per person per day (Pennybacker 18). Gourmet coffee houses are sprouting up all over the place. But what is the real story behind this dark brown liquid? Is it as innocent as it first seemsâ€”just a pleasant morning pick-me-up? Unfortunately it isnt. Much of todays coffee is grown in such a way that it damages the environment  although it has been proven that there are far less harmful methods. Coffee grows only in the tropics  in Mexico  Central and Latin America  Indonesia  and Africa. The field must be at an altitude between 3000 and 5000 feet with a temperature between 65 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit. For optimum growth  coffee must have shade from nearby trees and overhead growth  but it also requires at least two hours of sunlight each day (Shrinking Shadowland 60). These are the only requirements necessary for coffee to grow well. Coffee comes from small green beans that are really pits of a fruit resembling a cherry. The morning coffee poured into a mug comes from a small tree (or bush) that grew for seven years before it bloomed and grew the fruit that held the beans. After one of these trees produced one pound of coffee  its life was over (Shrinking 61). It was in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that coffee seeds from the Middle East took to the fertile soil of Latin America  the Caribbean  and Africa. It spread rampantly  with demand for the coffee growing in the northern part of the world. Millions of acres of rainforest and jungle were planted with coffee trees. However  that was not a completely detrimental move. Because of coffees need for shade and its ability to be grown alongside other crops  it didnt originally pose a hazard or threat to the environment. Habitats for animals were not drastically changed; indeed  the tropical ecosystems were much the same as before because the small coffee trees growing near the ground didnt require any forests to be cleared or plants eliminated. But this took a bad turn in 1970 when U.S. agricultural scientists decided to develop a new  high-yield coffee plant that grew only in the full sun. Farmers were easily convinced to adapt to this modernization because they could produce five times more coffee than before (Wille 63). With the support of local governments and the U.S. subsidization of $80 million towards the promotion of the new plant  it isnt difficult to understand why many traditional coffee fields quickly became modern ones (Greenberg 27). As as result  over the past 40 years  Central America has lost two-thirds of its rainforests to coffee plantations at a rate of 40 million acres per year (Pennybacker 18). That figure is similar to Mexico. These modern coffee plantations are so disastrous because they are mono-cultural; nothing can grow in the fields besides the stubby coffee bushes. According to Elizabeth Skinner  a director of the Rainforest Alliance  these modern plantations create ecological deserts that are growing at an alarming rate (Shrinking 63). As the rainforests disappear  so do the animals  especially migratory birds. One study found that bird species in coffee plantations have diminished by 94-97 percent since many farmers switched to sun-grown plantations. This is not surprising considering the fact that two-thirds of birds found in shade-grown coffee plantations live in the canopy of the trees  and less than ten percent actually feed among the coffee plants (Why Migratory Birds 2). At the turn of the century  there were 65 species of common migratory birds found in Guatemala. Today  only one-third of these birds have stable populations  another one-third seem to be in decline and 25 species are missing (Wille 62). Despite this  as Wille writes  No place in the world attracts such an extraordinary concentration of winter residents (59). For example  in Guatemala  which is the same size as Ohio  there can be found in winter almost as many bird species as is found in the U.S.  Central  and Latin America during the rest of the year. In fact  one-third of all migratory bird species that breed in the U.S. make that southern tropical part of the world their winter destination (Wille 59). However  the continued loss of rainforests due to sun-grown coffee fields is making it more and more difficult for these birds to find a place to migrate each winter. As the number of the birds decreases in Central and Latin America due to the spread of the sun plantations  they will also become a rarer sight in North America. Already in the last two decades of coffee industrialization  the number of birds detected by the National Weather Service Radar crossing the Gulf of Mexico has been depleted by half (Pennybacker 19). Not only do full-sun plantations threaten the existence of migratory birds  they are damaging to the environment in other ways as well. Due to the nature of the hybrid variety  the full-sun coffee plants possess little inbred resistance to pests and disease. This makes the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers necessary. It has become so mandatory  in fact  that coffee trees are the third most heavily sprayed crop in the world following cotton and tobacco (Shrinking 69). Seventy percent of the worlds coffee is sprayed with synthetic chemicals  some of which have been banned in the U.S. for years. Although not harmful to the coffee drinker because of the roasting process  the large amount of chemicals sprayed do harm the workers who cultivate the coffee. In July 1993  60 laborers on a Colombian coffee plantation were injured and one killed after they were exposed to high levels of endosulfan  a pesticide banned in many developed countries but commonly used on coffee plantations (Shrinking 64). These pesticides and fertilizers also kill insects and microrganisms and pollute the water. Sun plantations also contribute to soil erosion. The coffee trees must face not only the blasting heat with no protection  they must also endure the pounding rain from tropical rainstorms  which gradually washes much of the soil into little wandering toxic streams. Sun coffee fields are financially risky for the farmer because they can be damaged by harsh weather and because they limit farmers to one-crop farming. What then is the solution? What will reverse this potential ecological disaster? It is ironic that the solution can be found in the problem. Growing coffee on shade plantation rather than sun plantations doesnt strip the ecosystem to its bare bones; instead it will sustain it. There are many advantages to growing coffee on shade plantations. Shade farms can cultivate other crops  including cacao  fruit  avocados  and trees for firewood. This provides security for the farmer and promotes richer ecological diversity. The trees grown along with the coffee bushes on shade plantations add nitrogen into the soil. The leaf litter is home for many insects that devour the organisms that attack roots  while the shade trees protect coffee plants from the harsh rain and sun  help maintain soil quality  and reduce the need for labor-intensive weeding (Why Migratory Birds 3). Another advantage of shade farms is that plants and animals like to call these areas home. Due to the diversity of plants and trees found in shade plantations  the plantations are said to mimic natural forests (Wille 60). Researchers have found 66 species of trees and shrubs and 73 wildlife species in one single field. Full-sun fields host only 20 species of animals and plants (Wille 62). On one full-sun plantation no midsize terrestrial mammals were to be found  contrasting with 24 that were found on a full-shade plantation (Wille 63). These shade farms not only have a positive effect on the environment in general  but more specifically they are beneficial for migratory birds. The Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center has found over 150 species of birds on coffee fields and crop cacao plantations. That number is larger than all other habitats on the planet except for untouched tropical forests  which are disappearing at an alarming rate (Why Migratory Birds 1). In Mexico  the Caribbean islands  and Colombia  the areas where most migratory birds populate  the shade plantations are virtually indistinguishable from true forests and cover 2.7 million hectares  or almost half of the permanent cropland (Why Migratory Birds 2). Likewise  in Mexico coffee plantations cover an area over half the size of all the major moist tropical forest reserves  providing woodland habitat in areas where almost no large reserves are found. In El Salvador the traditional shade coffee plantations are about the only canopy habitat left in the country and account for about 60 percent of the surviving forested areas (Pennybacker 18). For this reason  the Salvadoran Minister of Agriculture and Livestock has officially classified coffee plantations as forest  alluding to the increasingly important role they play in the environment. Much of the coffee grown in that part of the world is for export to other countries  especially to the U.S. It is the third most common import in the U.S.  coming only after oil and steel. Of all the coffee produced in the world  Americans consume one third of it. Each year coffee brings in revenues of $10 billion (Why Migratory Birds 3). With this much control of the market  it shouldnt be too difficult for Americans to push for a more ecologically sound method of cultivating coffee  such as the use of shade plantations. Organic coffee is readily available in stores for the environmentally conscious and is certifiably grown without the use of chemicals and pesticides  likely on shade farms. While it is growing in popularity  organic coffee still makes up less than one percent of the 6.3 billion pounds of coffee imported into the U.S. each year (Pennybacker 19). The merits of full-sun coffee plantations dont even begin to measure up to the benefits of shade plantations. Shade plantations benefit both the workers and the environment. The few extra dollars paid for organic coffee might make the difference between seeing that black-throated green warbler in your yard again next spring or not.,the picture may seem familiar tumble out

7,I ran as fast as I could. I could see my destination just ahead of me. Just a little further   I kept saying to myself   just a little further and I will have made it to the land of the free and the home of the brave   the land of opportunity.  Diego finally got to his destination. He had gotten to America without getting caught. Now he could get the education to become a mechanic.    Like Diego   many illegal immigrants come to America every day for a better life and a better education. Whether these illegal immigrants should get the education they came for is very controversial in todays economy. Some Americans think that illegal immigrants shouldnt be eligible for instate tuition   but other Americans think that these illegal immigrants should be eligible for instate tuition. I am one who thinks that illegal immigrants should be eligible for instate tuition.  One of the most important arguments is that illegal immigrants pay taxes. By buying goods in America they are paying sales taxes   and in April most files and pay their [income] taxes. In fact   illegals pay about nine billion dollars in [Social Security] taxes every year. Where do these taxes go? They go to lowering the cost of instate tuition   making it so affordable today. So why shouldnt the illegal immigrants be eligible for instate tuition when they are helping to lower the price of the tuition?  Another important argument is one that our forefathers set forth to make a better nation. We hold these truths to be self-evident   that all men are created equalâ€¦and hold unalienable rights   among these are life   liberty   and the pursuit of happiness. If we are truly equal   then illegal immigrants deserve the same rights as we do for instate tuition.  However   some Americans say that illegal immigrants dont deserve instate tuition because they are sending money back to their home country and families. But we do not know how much money they are actually sending back   and besides   this helps spread the money around. It may even help a foreign country to get out of poverty. This could actually stop more illegal immigrants from coming to America because they would be stable enough from the money that is being sent to them so that they dont need to look to the land of opportunity for a job.  In conclusion   illegal immigrants should be eligible for instate tuition so   like Diego   they can follow their dreams. If you ever have to take a side on this issue   I hope you will consider mine.    ,i run as fast a i could i could see my destination just ahead of me just a little further i keep say to myself just a little further and i will have make it to the land of the free and the home of the brave the land of opportunity diego finally get to his destination he have get to america without get caught now he could get the education to become a mechanic like diego many illegal immigrant come to america every day for a good life and a good education whether these illegal immigrant should get the education they come for be very controversial in today economy some american think that illegal immigrant shouldnt be eligible for instate tuition but other american think that these illegal immigrant should be eligible for instate tuition i be one who think that illegal immigrant should be eligible for instate tuition one of the most important argument be that illegal immigrant pay tax by buy good in america they be pay sale tax and in april most file and pay their income tax in fact illegals pay about nine billion dollar in social security tax every year where do these tax go they go to lower the cost of instate tuition make it so affordable today so why shouldnt the illegal immigrant be eligible for instate tuition when they be help to lower the price of the tuition another important argument be one that our forefather set forth to make a good nation we hold these truth to be self evident that all men be create equal and hold unalienable right among these be life liberty and the pursuit of happiness if we be truly equal then illegal immigrant deserve the same right a we do for instate tuition however some american say that illegal immigrant dont deserve instate tuition because they be send money back to their home country and family but we do not know how much money they be actually send back and besides this help spread the money around it may even help a foreign country to get out of poverty this could actually stop more illegal immigrant from come to america because they would be stable enough from the money that be be send to them so that they dont need to look to the land of opportunity for a job in conclusion illegal immigrant should be eligible for instate tuition so like diego they can follow their dream if you ever have to take a side on this issue i hope you will consider mine,I ran as fast as I could .

5,Recently our class read an article in the Time for Kids Magazine. The title was Too Much Homework!? and it was about how much homework kids are doing today. It said that 100 years ago   kids never had any homework because they had to work on their farms or do chores for their families.  But in the 1950s   American kids began to score really low on math and science tests. Other countries were doing better than we were. Teachers thought that since their students were getting low grades   they should do some homework to practice and catch up to the rest of the world. Since then students have been getting more and more  homework and it doesnt look like that is going to change. I think that students should have enough homework   but still have time for fun. So   students in third grade should start having  15 minutes a night and work up to a little over an hour by the sixth grade. One reason to have homework is kids can become more responsible. For example   if someone usually forgets a due date   he can practice remembering and using an assignment book to help him remember his homework. When kids grow up and get a job   they will have deadlines to meet and homework is good practice for that.  Another reason to have homework is a kid can become faster at doing his work. If he needs to practice multiplication he can do that at home better than at school. Also   some kids who have big projects or posters would rather work where it is quiet and they can concentrate better. Also   long searches on the Internet are done at home easier than at school because you can be comfortable at home and you dont have a schedule to keep.  These are the reasons why I think students in third grade should start having 15 minutes a night and work up to a little over an hour by the sixth grade. If you agree with what I have said you should write a letter to a School addressed to the Superintendent and Principal so she can show it to the School Board.

Some of the characters in this story are: the Logans (Cassie   Stacey   Little Man   Christopher John   Mama   and Papa)   T.J. Avery   and Mr. Morrison. In the book   one of the characters   Mr. Morrison says   In those years I suppose it was just as hard being free as it was  being a slave. In this book response   I am going to use examples from the book to help explain why I agree with that quote.    One of the examples to support the quote is Soldiers Bridge. Soldiers Bridge is  a bridge on which white men have power over black men. The bridge has only one lane for only one car. If two people with the same skin color meet at the bridge   the person who reached the bridge first gets to go first. If a white and a black meet at the bridge   the white automatically gets to go first   always. This is true even if the black wagon/car is halfway across the bridge. The blacks would have to back off the bridge   and allow the whites to cross! This makes them feel like slaves obligated to obey their masters commands.    Another example is Mama losing her job. Mama lost her job as a school teacher because Mr. Granger   who is the school district manager (and who also wants the Logans land) claimed that Mama was teaching inappropriate information at the school   and should not be teaching anymore. Mr. Granger is white   and he feels strongly that whites are better than blacks. Mama was teaching about slavery and how black women/men were treated unfairly. He wanted a reason to fire her because without her paycheck   the Logans would not have enough money to pay the taxes for their land   and he might be able to get it.    Another example is the Jefferson School Bus (the white schools bus) that drives past Cassie   Stacey   Christopher John   and Little Man every morning as they walk to school. The driver and the children make fun of the Logans and laugh at them. If it has rained the night before   the driver would speed up and splash mud at the Logans. The Logan children felt mad   and humiliated   but they could do nothing to stop the white bus driver from doing this. They were like slaves   because they had no control over what was happening to them.    Yet another example to support Mr. Morrisons idea   is the Wallace store. The Wallace store is the local store where people shop (and which also sells alcoholic beverages). Most of the white men gather at the Wallace Store to drink   smoke   and play cards. If black skinned people were to enter the Wallace Store   the drinkers and smokers would insult them by calling them names   like nigger and they would make fun of them. The blacks would also always be served last. This is like Soldiers Bridge   because even if a black person was already being waited on   if a white person arrived   Mr. Wallace would stop waiting on the black person   and help the white person. This is definitely not fair.    My last example is the textbooks that the students are given in the black school. At first the black students were all excited about the new books   but when Little Man accepts his book   their point of view changes completely. The new textbooks are discards from a white school   where they were used until they were in very bad condition. Little Man ( who is very meticulous) refused to use his book because it was old and dirty. Little Mans teacher became mad and used the whip on him.    As you can see from the situations I have explained   life for the Logans during this time was completely unfair. They were treated unfairly   because their skin is black. The black skinned people in this story were treated with almost no respect from the white skinned people in this story. Although slavery had ended   these people were still treated like slaves because the whites would order them around   and they would have to obey   or risk their lives.  ,roll of thunder hear my cry by mildred taylor take place in mississippi in the s a time when segregation be present some of the character in this story be the logan cassie stacey little man christopher john mama and papa t j avery and mr morrison in the book one of the character mr morrison say in those year i suppose it be just as hard be free a it be be a slave in this book response i be go to use example from the book to help explain why i agree with that quote one of the example to support the quote be soldier bridge soldier bridge be a bridge on which white men have power over black men the bridge have only one lane for only one car if two people with the same skin color meet at the bridge the person who reach the bridge first get to go first if a white and a black meet at the bridge the white automatically get to go first always this be true even if the black wagon car be halfway across the bridge the black would have to back off the bridge and allow the white to cross this make them feel like slave obligate to obey their master command another example be mama lose her job mama lose her job a a school teacher because mr granger who be the school district manager and who also want the logan land claim that mama be teach inappropriate information at the school and should not be teach anymore mr granger be white and he feel strongly that white be good than black mama be teach about slavery and how black woman men be treat unfairly he want a reason to fire her because without her paycheck the logan would not have enough money to pay the tax for their land and he might be able to get it another example be the jefferson school bus the white school bus that drive past cassie stacey christopher john and little man every morning a they walk to school the driver and the child make fun of the logan and laugh at them if it have rain the night before the driver would speed up and splash mud at the logan the logan child felt mad and humiliate but they could do nothing to stop the white bus driver from do this they be like slave because they have no control over what be happen to them yet another example to support mr morrison idea be the wallace store the wallace store be the local store where people shop and which also sell alcoholic beverage most of the white men gather at the wallace store to drink smoke and play card if black skinned people be to enter the wallace store the drinker and smoker would insult them by call them name like nigger and they would make fun of them the black would also always be serve last this be like soldier bridge because even if a black person be already be wait on if a white person arrive mr wallace would stop wait on the black person and help the white person this be definitely not fair my last example be the textbook that the student be give in the black school at first the black student be all excite about the new book but when little man accept his book their point of view change completely the new textbook be discard from a white school where they be use until they be in very bad condition little man who be very meticulous refuse to use his book because it be old and dirty little man teacher become mad and use the whip on him a you can see from the situation i have explain life for the logan during this time be completely unfair they be treat unfairly because their skin be black the black skinned people in this story be treat with almost no respect from the white skinned people in this story although slavery have end these people be still treat like slave because the white would order them around and they would have to obey or risk their life,+ roll of + thunder + hear + my + cry by + mildred + taylor takes place in + mississippi in the 1930s a time when segregation was present . + some of the characters in this story are : the + logans ( + cassie + stacey + little + man + christopher + john + mama and + papa ) T .

6,Frogs: Today before we had writing groups Mrs. John read us a story about frogs.  We have a tadpole in the science center.  It has two back legs and when it has two front legs its tail disappears and it can not eat when its mouth is changing.  Then the skin gets too little and the frongs pull of their skin and then eat it.  Some of the frogs blow bubbles.  Frogs laid eggs that look like jelly and the fish ate some but some hatch to tadpoles.  It grows bigger and bigger and bigger,frog today before we have write group mrs john read u a story about frog we have a tadpole in the science center it have two back leg and when it have two front leg it tail disappears and it can not eat when it mouth be change then the skin get too little and the frongs pull of their skin and then eat it some of the frog blow bubble frog lay egg that look like jelly and the fish ate some but some hatch to tadpoles it grow big and big and big,+ frogs : + today before we had writing groups + mrs . + john read us a story about frogs . + we have a tadpole in the science center . + it has two back legs and when it has two front legs its tail disappears and it can not eat when its mouth is changing . + then the skin gets too little and the frongs pull of their skin and then eat it . + some of the frogs blow bubbles . + frogs laid eggs that look like jelly and the fish ate some but some hatch to tadpoles . + it grows bigger and bigger and bigger
6,Some people think that we are superior to animals but I think that animals are as smart as we are. Pets react to your moods and seem to know just when Its dinner time! Some animals use tools   communicate and think for their own.     If animals can use tools   they must be smart. For instance   a cow named Betty made a hook out of a piece of metal wire. Thats obviously pretty smart but she didnt stop there.She then used the hook to get treats out of a glass tube. I think this is smart because Betty figured out how to make a tool to get something she wanted. Another smart animal who used a tool was Fu Manchu the Orangutan. Fu Manchu first traded Food for wire with another orangutan and then he hid it in his mouth until the right time. Then he used the wire as a tool to pick the lock on his cage and escape. I think this shows Fu Manchu was smart because he used a tool and he outsmarted humans by escaping from his cage.    Animals who communicate might be even smarter than animals who use tools. For instance one clever gorilla actually learned sign language! Not only that but she started making her own signs. This showed scientists that she was trying to communicate her thoughts   which takes big brainpower. I think this is smart because when Koko made her own signs it showed that she wasnt just memorizing signs   she was thinking and making her own signs. Another smart animal who could understand communication was Betsy the dog. Betsy understands 340 spoken words! Not only that   but when someone showed her a picture of something she had never seen before she would go and get the item. I think this is really smart because Betsy didnt just memorize words she could recognize objects and fetch them. Betsy didnt really communicate   but I think she understood so much. Its just as good.    For animals who dont communicate or use tools there is another category: Animals that think on their own. For example   the poison dart Frog. Aside from protecting themselves with poison   they have AMAZING memories! The mothers hide their pollywogs in individual nests all over the jungle and had to remember where each one is and to come back every couple days to feed them! I think that is amazing how they think for their own because every pollywog (up to 35!) is in a different   camoflauged spot and their mom can still remember where each and every one is. Another example of animals thinking on their own is Alex   the African grey parrot. Alex can figure out alikeness and diference between two objects. For instance   when scientists hold up two objects and ask what the difference is he will answer either shape or color   depending on what it was. This is really smart because not only can Alex tell the difference he can tell what is the same about some objects. Id say that is a pretty smart bird to be able to figure out what was the same and different in his mind   but he also translated that out into words. Id say these animals are really smart in thinking on their own.    I know that some of you may think that animals are not smart. Some of you may think that animals are not smart. Some of you may think that most of the animals I talked about were special   that they were bred in a lab. But animals in natural life are smart too. For instance   a girl in my class named Erin has a farm   and every day her dad goes out at 2:30 AM to milk them. The cows line up at 2:25 am without being told. I think that this is smart because the cows know what time it is   AND line up early without being told. I think this is really smart of the cows. Another real life example of smart animals is my friend Mandys Cockatoo. Now   you all know Cockatoos repeat what is said. This Cockatoo   However takes it a step farther. Instead of just saying things at random times   she actually answers the door when the doorbell is rung. She dosnt open the door   but she does say things like Hello   and Come in. I think this is smart because instead of just saying random words   she responds with the right words at right time.    My goal of this essay was to convince you that animals were smart. You may have already known this and reading this essay was a waste of time to you. Or   you might have thought animals were not smart and still think that. If that is the case I have failed in my essay. However If you have changed your mind and now think that animals are smart   I have succeeded! I know that animals are smart   especially ones that use tools   communicate   and think for their own.  ,some people think that we be superior to animal but i think that animal be as smart a we be pet react to your mood and seem to know just when it dinner time some animal use tools communicate and think for their own if animal can use tool they must be smart for instance a cow name betty make a hook out of a piece of metal wire thats obviously pretty smart but she didnt stop there she then use the hook to get treat out of a glass tube i think this be smart because betty figure out how to make a tool to get something she want another smart animal who use a tool be fu manchu the orangutan fu manchu first trade food for wire with another orangutan and then he hide it in his mouth until the right time then he use the wire a a tool to pick the lock on his cage and escape i think this show fu manchu be smart because he use a tool and he outsmart human by escape from his cage animal who communicate might be even smart than animal who use tool for instance one clever gorilla actually learn sign language not only that but she start make her own sign this show scientist that she be try to communicate her thought which take big brainpower i think this be smart because when koko make her own sign it show that she wasnt just memorize sign she be think and make her own sign another smart animal who could understand communication be betsy the dog betsy understand spoken word not only that but when someone show her a picture of something she have never see before she would go and get the item i think this be really smart because betsy didnt just memorize word she could recognize object and fetch them betsy didnt really communicate but i think she understand so much it just a good for animal who dont communicate or use tool there be another category animal that think on their own for example the poison dart frog aside from protect themselves with poison they have amaze memory the mother hide their pollywog in individual nest all over the jungle and have to remember where each one be and to come back every couple day to fee them i think that be amaze how they think for their own because every pollywog up to be in a different camoflauged spot and their mom can still remember where each and every one be another example of animal think on their own be alex the african grey parrot alex can figure out alikeness and diference between two object for instance when scientist hold up two object and ask what the difference be he will answer either shape or color depend on what it be this be really smart because not only can alex tell the difference he can tell what be the same about some object id say that be a pretty smart bird to be able to figure out what be the same and different in his mind but he also translate that out into word id say these animal be really smart in think on their own i know that some of you may think that animal be not smart some of you may think that animal be not smart some of you may think that most of the animal i talk about be special that they be breed in a lab but animal in natural life be smart too for instance a girl in my class name erin have a farm and every day her dad go out at be to milk them the cow line up at be without be tell i think that this be smart because the cow know what time it be and line up early without be tell i think this be really smart of the cow another real life example of smart animal be my friend mandys cockatoo now you all know cockatoos repeat what be say this cockatoo however take it a step far instead of just say thing at random time she actually answer the door when the doorbell be rung she dosnt open the door but she do say thing like hello and come in i think this be smart because instead of just say random word she respond with the right word at right time my goal of this essay be to convince you that animal be smart you may have already know this and read this essay be a waste of time to you or you might have think animal be not smart and still think that if that be the case i have fail in my essay however if you have change your mind and now think that animal be smart i have succeed i know that animal be smart especially one that use tool communicate and think for their own,+ some people think that we are superior to animals but I think that animals are as smart as we are . + pets react to your moods and seem to know just when + its dinner time ! + some animals use tools communicate and think for their own . + if animals can use tools they must be smart . + for instance a cow named + betty made a hook out of a piece of metal wire . + thats obviously pretty smart but she didnt stop *url then used the hook to get treats out of a glass tube .

7,I ran as fast as I could. I could see my destination just ahead of me. Just a little further   I kept saying to myself   just a little further and I will have made it to the land of the free and the home of the brave   the land of opportunity.    Diego finally got to his destination. He had gotten to America without getting caught. Now he could get the education to become a mechanic.      Like Diego   many illegal immigrants come to America every day for a better life and a better education. Whether these illegal immigrants should get the education they came for is very controversial in todays economy. Some Americans think that illegal immigrants shouldnt be eligible for instate tuition   but other Americans think that these illegal immigrants should be eligible for instate tuition. I am one who thinks that illegal immigrants should be eligible for instate tuition.    One of the most important arguments is that illegal immigrants pay taxes. By buying goods in America they are paying sales taxes   and in April most files and pay their [income] taxes. In fact   illegals pay about nine billion dollars in [Social Security] taxes every year. Where do these taxes go? They go to lowering the cost of instate tuition   making it so affordable today. So why shouldnt the illegal immigrants be eligible for instate tuition when they are helping to lower the price of the tuition?    Another important argument is one that our forefathers set forth to make a better nation. We hold these truths to be self-evident   that all men are created equalâ€¦and hold unalienable rights   among these are life   liberty   and the pursuit of happiness. If we are truly equal   then illegal immigrants deserve the same rights as we do for instate tuition.    However   some Americans say that illegal immigrants dont deserve instate tuition because they are sending money back to their home country and families. But we do not know how much money they are actually sending back   and besides   this helps spread the money around. It may even help a foreign country to get out of poverty. This could actually stop more illegal immigrants from coming to America because they would be stable enough from the money that is being sent to them so that they dont need to look to the land of opportunity for a job.    In conclusion   illegal immigrants should be eligible for instate tuition so   like Diego   they can follow their dreams. If you ever have to take a side on this issue   I hope you will consider mine.    ,i run as fast a i could i could see my destination just ahead of me just a little further i keep say to myself just a little further and i will have make it to the land of the free and the home of the brave the land of opportunity diego finally get to his destination he have get to america without get caught now he could get the education to become a mechanic like diego many illegal immigrant come to america every day for a good life and a good education whether these illegal immigrant should get the education they come for be very controversial in today economy some american think that illegal immigrant shouldnt be eligible for instate tuition but other american think that these illegal immigrant should be eligible for instate tuition i be one who think that illegal immigrant should be eligible for instate tuition one of the most important argument be that illegal immigrant pay tax by buy good in america they be pay sale tax and in april most file and pay their income tax in fact illegals pay about nine billion dollar in social security tax every year where do these tax go they go to lower the cost of instate tuition make it so affordable today so why shouldnt the illegal immigrant be eligible for instate tuition when they be help to lower the price of the tuition another important argument be one that our forefather set forth to make a good nation we hold these truth to be self evident that all men be create equal and hold unalienable right among these be life liberty and the pursuit of happiness if we be truly equal then illegal immigrant deserve the same right a we do for instate tuition however some american say that illegal immigrant dont deserve instate tuition because they be send money back to their home country and family but we do not know how much money they be actually send back and besides this help spread the money around it may even help a foreign country to get out of poverty this could actually stop more illegal immigrant from come to america because they would be stable enough from the money that be be send to them so that they dont need to look to the land of opportunity for a job in conclusion illegal immigrant should be eligible for instate tuition so like diego they can follow their dream if you ever have to take a side on this issue i hope you will consider mine,I ran as fast as I could .

8,Dear Teachers   I believe that we should participate in shutdown your screen week. I think that everyone in the school should not use any electronics for one week. Since the invention of the computer   cellphone and other electronics   people have been using them more and more and more. These electronics have big upsides   youre never alone if you have cell service and Facebook allows people to talk to multiple friends at once when theyre not in the same room   town   state   or country. But they also have their downsides. What makes us truly great is our ability to think deeply and focus   but when we use electronics or the internet we arent doing either of these things. In fact   using these things makes us think more shallow and focus less. I think that we should participate in  shut down your screen week.    One reason is that using electronics and multi-tasking causes focus problems   on and off computers. In Attached to Technology and Paying a Price by Matt Richtel   it says   Scientists say juggling email   phone calls   and other incoming information can change how people think and behave. They say our ability to focus is being undermined by bursts of information. This ability to focus is enormously important   its one of the things that we depend on almost every day. Like when youre driving a car to work or flying a plane. If youre distracted while doing one of these things it can have dire consequences for yourself and for others. Multi-tasking can also affect creativity   deep thought   causing problems for work and family life. By participating we could give people a chance to develop new habits of not using their phone or computer all the time.    A second reason that we should participate is that heavy multitaskers have trouble filtering out irrelevant information on and off the computer. In Attached to Technology and Paying the Price by Matt Richtel it says the multitaskers had trouble filtering out the blue ones â€“ the irrelevant information. If we participated   we could give these people a chance to develop new habits that would help them filter out irrelevant information and only pay attention to the things that are important. For example   if someones playing with their daughter   they would check their email every time they received an email instead of focusing on playing with their daughter.    Now   some people say that we shouldnt participate because technology makes you smarter   why stop doing something thats helping yourself. In an imaging study by Dr. Small   he found that Internet users showed greater brain activity than nonusers   suggesting they were growing their neural circuitry. While they may be growing their neural circuitry   they were also changing a characteristic of the brain that was thought to be unchangeable   the ability to only process one stream of information at a time. This ability allows humans to think deeply   an important characteristic in todays society. By changing it   they were preventing themselves from having the ability to think deeply.    Technology is a new thing   and it has many advantages and conveniences. But for many it becomes more than a convenience   it becomes an obsession. For this reason I believe that we should participate in shut down your screen week   to give people a chance to make new habits  and make technology a convenience again   not a necessity. ,dear teacher i believe that we should participate in shutdown your screen week i think that everyone in the school should not use any electronics for one week since the invention of the computer cellphone and other electronics people have be use them more and more and more these electronics have big upside youre never alone if you have cell service and facebook allow people to talk to multiple friend at once when theyre not in the same room town state or country but they also have their downside what make u truly great be our ability to think deeply and focus but when we use electronics or the internet we arent do either of these thing in fact use these thing make u think more shallow and focus less i think that we should participate in shut down your screen week one reason be that use electronics and multi tasking cause focus problem on and off computer in attach to technology and pay a price by matt richtel it say scientist say juggle email phone call and other incoming information can change how people think and behave they say our ability to focus be be undermine by burst of information this ability to focus be enormously important it one of the thing that we depend on almost every day like when youre drive a car to work or fly a plane if youre distract while do one of these thing it can have dire consequence for yourself and for others multi task can also affect creativity deep think cause problem for work and family life by participate we could give people a chance to develop new habit of not use their phone or computer all the time a second reason that we should participate be that heavy multitaskers have trouble filter out irrelevant information on and off the computer in attach to technology and pay the price by matt richtel it say the multitaskers have trouble filter out the blue one the irrelevant information if we participate we could give these people a chance to develop new habit that would help them filter out irrelevant information and only pay attention to the thing that be important for example if someone play with their daughter they would check their email every time they receive an email instead of focus on play with their daughter now some people say that we shouldnt participate because technology make you smart why stop do something thats help yourself in an imaging study by dr small he find that internet user show great brain activity than nonusers suggest they be grow their neural circuitry while they may be grow their neural circuitry they be also change a characteristic of the brain that be think to be unchangeable the ability to only process one stream of information at a time this ability allow human to think deeply an important characteristic in today society by change it they be prevent themselves from have the ability to think deeply technology be a new thing and it have many advantage and convenience but for many it become more than a convenience it become an obsession for this reason i believe that we should participate in shut down your screen week to give people a chance to make new habit and make technology a convenience again not a necessity,+ dear + teachers I believe that we should participate in shutdown your screen week .

8,That one day little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today.  -Martin Luther King   Jr.      As years have gone by   as we take actions and feel emotions   we embark upon a search for something to describe the indescribable   to understand the most complicated of thoughts   and to ease unrelenting pain. It is in this search that we stumble upon literature   and we have learned that it can be one of the most effective tools to both spiritually and bodily heal the wounds of human nature.    Martin Luther King   Jr.s message of equality is one that has stayed rooted deep in American history. He speaks of a problem that must not be neglected. In many cases   the key to problems such as these is understanding and awareness. Through literature we find that we benefit through both. Really great literature speaks to you forever   despite years of actions taken and emotions felt.    An example of such literature is the book The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn   by Mark Twain. Through its main character   Huckleberry Finn   a young   boisterous white boy who has recently run away   and his friend Jim   a runaway slave   live the values of America and the values of a very turbulent   but loyal friendship.    Regardless of its message   Mark Twains talent and its ability to withstand   The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is at risk of being taken off the shelves of schools across the country. As an American student   I firmly believe that we must make a stand against this potentially great loss   and make sure that The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is kept in our schools and in our minds for the sake of describing the indescribable   understanding the most complicated of thoughts and easing pain.    Some may disagree with the message conveyed by Mark Twain in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. With fire in their eyes they say that such a book encourages bad behavior and addresses racism in such a way that it should not be on school shelves.    First   they find that Huck is too unlawful a child to be portrayed as a hero. He steals   lies   and runs away. He has no problem going against the law or his own conscience and takes pride in achievements he has been taught not to strive for   they point out. However   to this point we shake our head. Many   many books have characters that lead lives that todays children are taught against. Among the pages of The Old Testament   Cain   brother of Able   stands clearly as a wrong-doer in order to help us better understand the negative forces of human nature. Though some may believe that Huck is among these undying wrong-doers   he may well be   like Cain   an example of how not to act. Yet you cannot classify Huck as a bad or good person   he is one of the many complicated characters that call the pages of great literature home. When stealing   Huck is actually borrowing   his lies cause him great stress and come back to haunt him. When he runs away   he is running from an abusive father   taking control of a situation that was headed for disaster. When he goes against his conscience it is for the sake of a friend. In that case   Huck decides that the laws of human nature are more important than the laws that are ignorant   laws that discriminate   laws that could undeservingly take away what is yours. Huck is indeed no criminal   and if anything his values are something to be admired.    Those who still believe that The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn should be taken off our schools shelves say that it addresses racism in a way that is inappropriate for students. But that point   like the other   holds no water. It addresses racism in an appropriate and indeed necessary format. Like Martin Luther King Jr.s message   it enables us to understand and at the same time helps us become aware of how poorly African-Americans were treated during the time the book was set   and it does this in a true-to-life and very real layout. Also   Huck and Jim strike a friendship that white people and slaves could not have in the limits of society during the time period and this reminds the reader in many places that everyone deserves the same freedom and equality.    You must also take into account that if there is any place to read a book with possibly risky content it would be inside classrooms   classrooms where the material would certainly be discussed and explained. In class is perhaps the safest place for one to read this book   or any book that could result in conflicting viewpoints. To take it off the shelves of schools would be to take away the ability to help children understand and be aware of the deeper meaning   and therefore they would be worse off than if it were to be in their schools.    In light of the past arguments   we must now press on to show you what an excellent book The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain really is. It is a book that contains important illustrations of racism and how to overcome it   as well as many American values.    First   The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn illustrates a struggle  that has been deeply rooted in our past   and remains deeply rooted in the present. Though we have come a long way   a wall built of racial cloud still stands. Huck and Jim find a way to get past this wall and despite slavery and the examples set in society   treat each other as equals. In Chapter 15  titled Fooling Poor Old Jim Huck tries to play a trick on Jim to make fun of him   not thinking about Jims feelings. When Jim discovers the truth he is deeply hurt   but is able to express that to Huck. Hearing of his friends sadness   Huck in turn apologies for his actions.    En when I wake up en fine you back agin   all safe en soun   de tears come   en I could â€˜a got down on my knees en kiss yo foot   Is so thankful. En all you wuz thinking â€˜bout wuz how you could make a fool uv ole Jim wid a lie. Dat truck dah is trash; en trash is what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey frens en makes â€˜em ashamed. Then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam   and went in there without saying anything but that. But that was enough. It made me  feel so mean I could almost kissed his foot to get him to take it back. It was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble myself to a nigger â€“ but I done it and I warent every sorry for it afterward   neither. I didnt do him no more mean tricks   and I wouldnt done that one if Id â€˜a knowed it would make him feel that way.    It is a very important time in this book when Jim is able to express to Huck how being lied to hurt him   especially when he thought of Huck as a friend. After Jim has spoken of feelings and retired for bed   Huck takes time to reflect upon his actions   and how they made Jim feel. Fifteen minutes later   despite what society taught him   Huck apologies to Jim as only a friend would   and takes what Jim says to heart.    Not only does The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn address racism in an appropriate way and remarkably find a way to overcome it   but in many ways it reminds the reader of the important values that can only too often be forgotten in America. One of the biggest is freedom. Both Huck and Jim are searching for freedom   escaping the imprisonment of slavery and an abusive father. Another value that is evident is equality. As expressed in the quote above   Huck and Jim find that equality is an essential in their friendship. Through this understanding   they manage to stay friends despite all that life throws their way.    One clear and significant value shows in this book is perseverance. Both Huck and Jim set a valiant and enduring example of this value throughout the book. Despite Hucks father and slave catchers close on their trail; a rattlesnake skin that constantly brings them bad luck; a wrecked ship that accommodated a murder plot; a tumultuous friendship and a family blinded by bloodshed   Huck and Jim find themselves pushing that much harder to reach the freedom that their hearts desire. They find courage and want within each other   and as a heroic duo conquer all that flows to them upon the river of life.    There are many values evident in this book that are set down in the Declaration of Independence   and values that have stood the test of time. This brings us back to the fact that The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn must be taught in schools. As Huck and Jim lead their lives they set the examples that are crucial to students education. When people learn how to treat each other and learn significant values at a young age   they are given the opportunity to apply those lessons to their future and in turn teach their children. To leave these lessons behind would be doing these students a disservice   for it is lessons like these that teach us who we are   who we need to be.    Great literature is a food that is scarce   but it will always be universal. Do your part to foster its presence in your life   and the life of the youth of America. As years have gone by   as actions are taken and emotions are felt   we all search for something to describe the indescribable   to understand an idea that is conflicting   or to ease unrelenting pain. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain is a possible outcome of that search   teaching the significance of friendship   freedom and equality. Under the nose of a visceral world   two differing runaways find shelter in a friendship banned from society. In this friendship   they teach the world the importance of understanding and the importance of great literature.         ,that one day little black boy and black girl will be able to join hand with

8,Great people of North Dakota      I   Senator McCumber   [an actual Senator from 1919 in the League of Nations debate]   have just participated in a debate regarding whether or not America should sign the Treaty of Versailles   and in doing so   join the League of Nations. The League of Nations is a unified group of nations dedicated to the preservation of peace. The League is designed to deal with international issues   adjudicating differences between countries instead of them going directly to combat.    Now   in the interests of the great state of North Dakota   I voted in favor of the treaty with no reservations. We need a fair treaty to prevent future wars as horrible as the Great War was. After the war   the central powers composed the Treaty of Versailles to create the League of Nations in an attempt to ward off future conflicts. We cannot have another war as horrible as this one. I believe   because of that   that we need a fair treaty   equal to all its members   that will restrict the use of new weapons   and prevent future wars from breaking out.  First   the Treaty and the League will control the use of new weapons. As stated in Article VII   One of its (the Leagues) jobs will be to come up with a plan for reducing the number of weapons around the world (arms reduction). This means that the League will be in charge of weapons issues. This will cause heavily armed countries to demilitarize and make it less possible for war to break out. This is good because heavily armed countries generally end up using those arms in some way.  Another reason why I believe we need to sign the Treaty with no reservations is we need a treaty that is fair to all its members. Reservations [proposed by the Leagues opponents] would give America too much power within the league   thus allowing America to bend the rules of the League to suit its own will. This would cause unrest in the League   possibly causing America to make enemies. This could lead to another war. The treaty should be as fair as possible.  Yet another reason why I voted for America to sign the treaty is the fact it would prevent future wars from breaking out. The way the League is designed   it would give plenty of time for the League to settle the countries differences with a fair and equal compromise. If war were to break out   the council members in the League would all help in defending each other   thus ending the war as quickly as possible with as few deaths as possible. The treaty would prevent war from happening or end the fighting as quickly as possible.  Some people say that we shouldnt join the League because we would be intervening in foreign affairs   that it would cause another war. How can you not intervene when 8 million people died in the last war? How can you stand there with  a clear conscience when you know you could have prevented all that carnage from ever happening? The League will help countries settle their differences with plenty of time to talk it over. Six months for the countries to listen to the councils advice   and after that another three months before they can mobilize. If we join the League   we will keep anything like the Great War from happening again.  In conclusion   the Treaty of Versailles needs to be signed so the League will be put into affect. The League of Nations will prevent war from breaking out   restrict weapons development and militarism   and keep us from the horrors of another Great War.

9,To whom it may concern:      High School  should not participate in the national Shut Down Your Screen Week. Technology can be beneficial   especially to students. A vast majority of students finds it helpful to have access to technology. Technology makes quicker   more efficient work. Without the advancements of technology   we are no farther along than school children in the 1960s.    The internet and social media   such as Facebook   improve the social lives of those who use it. In the article Information   Communication and Society   a survey found that whether the participants were married or single   people who used social media had more close friends. An average American who uses social media is half as likely to be socially isolated. They also know more diverse people. Also   users of social media never lose ties because of relocating   because you can always keep your friends on social media.    Internet search engines allow us better access to information. In my experience   information is far more accessible and quick than searching through books. That allows for time to complete other class assignments. According to Peter Norvig   director of research for Google   Inc.   in an article for the New York Times   The internet contains the worlds best writing   images   and ideas; Google lets us find the relevant pieces instantly. Some argue that ads and irrelevant sites may be distracting   but more find that the benefits are worth it. Eighty-one percent of experts polled by the Pew Internet Research Project  support this opinion.    The internet also makes a good learning tool. In an article by Matt Richtel for the New  York Times   he proves that it helps our brains. Imaging studies show the brains of Internet users become more efficient at finding information. Basically   the more we use online resources to learn   the better our brains become at learning. Also   in the same article   it says   Internet users showed greater brain activity than non-usersâ€¦ The internet even develops our brain to think more! Technology is improving our brains.    I have heard it argued that children rot their brains with video game systems. In the previously mentioned article by Matt Richtel   he says   At the University of Rochester   researchers found that players of some fast-paced video games can track the movement of a third more objects on a screen than nonplayersâ€¦games can improve reaction time and the ability to pick out details amid clutter. It seems that the more people play fast-paced video games   the more efficient they become at finding important details. These games may not be so brain rotting  after all. They could even be argued as beneficial.    Some also argue that because of new technologies   people limit how much they associate together   even in the same area. Social media disproves this argument. Not only can people associate easily with friends   they can also chat with relatives. They can also show relatives photos   even if they are states away. People who use social media are more likely to know more diverse people   according to the article by Keith Hampton. People still associate with people  just as much as before   if not more. They are merely doing it in a different manner than before social media was in use.    Cyber bullying has now become an issue. I would like to bring to attention that all bullying is a big issue. I do not think that technology has caused bullying. It has just allowed for a new way to bully someone. I have never been cyber-bullied. I personally was bullied in a face-to-face manner. A bully will take any chance to bully a target. Social media has not caused bullying.    Like most tools   technology is useful if used correctly. Work quality on a computer can be better   because people have more time to check over their work and improve it. Unfortunately   some people are lazy   and use that extra time they could use for editing for other things. That is not a problem with the tools   it is a problem with the people. People who use such technology correctly and efficiently should still have access. If our screens are shut down   there is no access. We should not participate in Shut Down Your Screen Week.          Sincerely  9  Is It Love?    One of the most misunderstood emotions is love. There are so many different perspectives that it can be interpreted as something completely opposite of its intention. Harper Lee   the author of To Kill a Mockingbird states that its a love story   plain and simple. This statement confuses many people because her book is anything but a romance novel. However   that is not the kind of love she is referring to. This is the love among family   friends   neighbors   and enemies. This love is called agape   and as Martin Luther King defines it   it is a disinterested love in which the individual seeks not his own good   but the good of his neighborâ€¦it begins by loving others for their sakesâ€¦its a love seeking to preserve and create community (King 19-20). In To Kill a Mockingbird   love is brought up in many ways. Love is shown throughout the book as different actions by the characters coming together so they can understand each other.    Atticus shows love towards his neighbor Ms. Dubose   even though she is completely disrespectful towards him. Everyday she insults Atticus and his children because he is defending Tom Robinson   but he does nothing to stop her. Instead   he sends Jem over to her house everyday for about a month to read to her. One day   it is Atticus who goes to her house   and he stays for most of the day. When he returns home   he tells Jem that she has died   and the reason he had to read to her was because  Ms. Dubose was a morphine addict(147). Atticus knew that she wanted to die free   and he helped her achieve her goal by sending Jem to read to her   so she could get her mind off the drug. She said she was going to leave this world beholden to nothing and nobody Atticus tells Jem (148). This is when Atticus and Jem realize her true determination to no longer be a morphine addict   and its in this way that they both truly understand her. Even though she was dying   Atticus still sends Jem to read to her everyday to help her become sober. Even when she is dying   Ms. Dubose is still trying to conquer her addiction   and its for that reason Atticus says   She was the bravest person I ever knew (149). Love is shown here because even though Ms. Dubose is completely disrespectful towards Atticus   he steps up to help her die free. This is an example of agape because instead of fighting hate with hate   Atticus loves Ms. Dubose   and by doing so   he is able to understand her   and therefore love her.    Another place love shows up is during the trial. Atticus truly believes that Tom Robinson is not guilty   and he goes out of his way to prove his point in courts. A majority of Maycomb is mad at Atticus for even taking the case   let alone actually trying to set him free. Atticus turns to the jury and tells them   I am confident that you gentlemen will review without passion the evidence you have heard   come to a decision   and restore this defendant to his family(275). Atticus fights as hard as he can to prove his case   but it just isnt what people want to hear. The jury votes Tom Robinson guilty   and less than a week later he is shot. This upsets Atticus   and especially Jem. But Atticus comforts Jem by telling him it affected somebody on the jury   because one of the Cunninghams wanted to vote â€˜not guilty. Confused   Jem says    One minute theyre tryin to kill him and the next theyre tryin to turn him looseâ€¦Ill never understand those folks as long as I live (298). Jem is too young to really understand   but Atticus knows his case is changing the views and thoughts of racism in their community. After the trial   Atticus is surprised to find that the entire black community gave his family a surplus of food as a thank you. This touches his heart because he starts crying   and he tell Calpurnia to Tell them Im very grateful (86). We again see love in this situation because Atticus got the jury to understand Tom   even though he ends up dead. Also   when Toms friends and family reach out to thank Atticus for his efforts and his true support in the trial   we can see that there is understanding. One step at a time   Atticus is changing the thoughts of the people in the community to make it stronger by using agape.    One of the places we see the most love is with Boo Radley. He is just a misunderstood man who Jem and Scout torment and talk about throughout the summer. Boo   however   does little things to change their opinion of him. One night when there is a fire   Boo Radley comes out of his house and puts a blanket on Scout without knowing- a very loving and caring gesture. When Jem tells Atticus   he says   Someday   maybe   Scout can thank him for covering her up (96).After this   the kids start thinking of Boo differently. One night   after the play   Jem and Scout are attacked in the woods by Mr. Ewell when they are walking home. Suddenly   somebody kills their attacker and brings injured Jem home. Its not until they are home that Scout realizes it was Boo who saved them. Hey   Boo she says (362). This is the part of the story that the reader sees how much Boo Radley loves Jem and Scout. When Scout looks out from Boos porch   she glimpses his perspective   and summarized the events that took place over the summer   and thinks   Autumn again   and Boos children needed him (374). Boo cares for these children so much that he considers them his own kids. This is another example of agape   because hes giving without expecting anything in return. Its when Jem and Scout finally realize this that they know they love him back   which brings them closer together.    We see countless examples of love throughout the book through the characters actions. Martine Luther states that agape is understanding (King 19). The more the characters understand each other   the more they come to care and love each other. This makes them all   as a community   much stronger. Its a love story   plain and simple Harper Lee states. Not a romance   but a book in which agape is shown throughout. This is a book of understanding   and when theres understanding   there is agape. This love is important because this is what human nature needs in order to become united. King and Lee see this importance   and consider agape a tool used to bring people together to make a stronger community.                        ,to whom it may concern high school should not

10,On the first day of school   the students walk into the classroom and see a book on every desk. The teachers happily greets them and tells everyone to sit at a desk with a book that seems interesting to them. The pupils tentatively sit down in their seats and look up at their young teacher for instructions   but she sits down and is soon deeply absorbed in her story   eyes shimmering in the light. The pupils gaze in wonder at her and slowly crack open their books. Weve grown up reading   but not very often do we see a teacher who exemplifies reading. Reading is recurrently a forced activity. Therefore   people both young and old feel like they HAVE to read   and so its only something they have to do for school or work. They dont see it as an amazing skill that will not only help with their futures but also a great hobby to enjoy in life. Continuing to silent read for at least the first ten minutes of every class is a very good idea.    The first reason why reading is class is a good idea is because it helps get some of our required silent reading done. Envision Anne   an active   sweet young lady who participates in sports and also plays a big part in the school play. The little time she spends at home every day is reserved for homework assignments and memorizing her lines. Time reading in class at school cuts down on the time Anne has to make in order to read. Reading is important to Anne but she knows she cant possibly read and make good reflections if she doesnt have the time to do so. Some people just dont have the time   so making them read more outside of school is like telling the workers of IBM to go play a football game every day- theres just not enough time outside of work and school.    There are people who say that silent reading doesnt help low level readers   but it reality   it actually helps a lot. James McNair has many techniques to help children better comprehend what they are reading. He says that children can get bored with reading if it has no meaning to them (i.e. when reading as a class   not everyone is on the same level   and therefore   the lower level readers are not as interested). Once a child discovers the wonders of reading   they are sure to come across words they dont know (2). When this happens   silent reading will surely help because they can go over words they do know   and learn as they go. This really helps since classwork reading may be harder for lower level readers and they have many words they dont understand as opposed to learning a couple new words a day. They need practice in order to read better so if students are not surrounded by reading then they will not get better. In a research evaluation by Chow & Chou   9th grade students were allowed 10 minutes each day to silent read and improved their reading skills by the end of the year (4). This is solid proof that having time to read in class is a benefit to everyone.    Silent reading is not only fun   it paves way for tests â€“ no one is allowed to read out loud or have questions read to them during a test. All tests require you to read at least questions. This doesnt include the rereading you need to do when you write essays for a test   an example being the NECAPs. Based on the National Center for Educational Statistics of 2008  reading is one of the few factors that can be the big change in test scores. The more you practice reading   the more enhanced your vocabulary gets. This helps not only the reading part   but also the writing parts   most importantly on standardized tests. Getting students to read in school ensures at least some practice for the testing that the United States schools have for students.    Not only is silent reading useful   it allows students to choose what they want to read   which in turn can help their future. Too frequently   class discussions are based on books that the teacher selects for their students to read. Students may get bored of always having their choices made for them and some even take it for granted and can soon forget how to deal with life on their own. KC   an avid reader   agrees: Picking your own books allows you to be more prepared for real life   not just a classroom where decisions are typically made for you. By having the choice to find their own books   students become more independent in the process. School prepares them for life   but their choices prepare them for their future.    Silent reading during school hours has been a widely argued situation in many school districts of the world. We should continue to have silent reading for at least ten minutes every day   especially because of Winooski High Schools Tier 1 situation. Our school officials say that our NECAP scores are getting lower and require more structure to help fix it. If thats the case   then silent reading could only help raise the scores reading well is a big part of the NECAPs   not only when we read the essays but also to read the questions that accompany them. Having a good knowledge of reading and reading strategies will help our school and a good start to getting there is through silent reading. ,on the first day of school the student walk into the

7,Dear Teachers      I have recently begun learning about the Shut Down Your Screen week. This is a program where kids in school and out of school dont use any electronics for one week. Everyone in your school would participate. This is a way to save the way we think and try something new. My question is   should we participate in the national Shut Down Your Screen Week? I think it would be a good idea for many reasons.    First   I think we should participate because using too much technology affects the way we think and behave. In the article Attached to Technology and Paying a Price by Matt Richtel  it gives many scientifically proven facts that using technology too much affects the way we think. If you are juggling e-mail   phone calls and other incoming information it can lose peoples focus. Also as the text states   The stimulation provokes excitement that researchers say can be addictive. In its absence   people feel bored. This means that people can become addicted and when not using technology become bored with things they used to love to do.    Another reason I think we should participate in this program is because using technology while doing something else (multitasking) really just creates more trouble focusing. Scientists did an experiment where they took someone that multitasks and someone that doesnt. It was proven that even though the multitasker multitasks more   they did a worse job than the other person. Therefore technology and multi-tasking does nothing for you.    Another reason I think we should participate is it puts a bad toll on children. Some people may say that playing a video game or watching a movie with your family helps to bond with family. That may be true   but you can get addicted and not want to do anything else. Lily   a second grader   is allowed only an hour a day of unstructured time   which she often spends with her devices. This shows that kids are playing on devices and not outside or with friends. If we participate   we   the kids   can do other things and be more social.    Therefore   I think we should participate in the  Shut Down Your Screen Week.  Thank you for your time.

2,How are the parts of a plant important? Here are some ways the parts of a plant are important. One way is that the roots suck nutrients from the soil so the plants can grow. Roots also secure the plant in the ground so it doesnt blow away. Another important part is the flowers. Seeds are kept in flowers   and the flower keeps the seeds safe. Stems are also important. They carry nutrients through the plant. Leaves are also important. Leaves collect sunlight for food for the plant. And   last but not least   are the seeds. When a seed gets in the ground   the plants life begins. Those are some things that show how the parts of a plant are important.,how be the part of a plant important here be some way the part of a plant be important one way be that the root suck nutrient from the soil so the plant can grow root also secure the plant in the ground so it doesnt blow away another important part be the flower seed be keep in flower and the flower keep the seed safe stem be also important they carry nutrient through the plant leaf be also important leaf collect sunlight for food for the plant and last but not least be the seed when a seed get in the ground the plant life begin those be some thing that show how the part of a plant be important,+ how are the parts of a plant important ? + here are some ways the parts of a plant are important . + one way is that the roots suck nutrients from the soil so the plants can grow . + roots also secure the plant in the ground so it doesnt blow away . + another important part is the flowers . + seeds are kept in flowers and the flower keeps the seeds safe . + stems are also important . + they carry nutrients through the plant . + leaves are also important . + leaves collect sunlight for food for the plant . + and last but not least are the seeds . + when a seed gets in the ground the plants life begins . + those are some things that show how the parts of a plant are important . 
2,Its hard to train a snow search dog. First   you have to get a pup. They have to love hunting things so they can find people. They have to have a thick coat  to stay warm. They have to be strong to climb mountains. Its hard to know which pup is right for you. Next   you need to train the pup. First   you need to play hide and go seek with the dog. The handler goes and hides under the snow and the other person lets go of the leash. The person that is hiding has dog treats. If the dog finds him   the dog gets a treat.

3,What can I do to save water? Lots of people waste gallons of water a day. Some people dont even have 5â€“2 gallons of water a day. We need water to drink   wash clothes   bathe   and much more   so we need to save water. One good way to save water is to leave buckets outside to fill up with rain. Take quick showers. Baths take at least 37 gallons of water. Remind people to turn off the water when not in use. Lots of people wait for the water from their sinks to get hot and cold. Put a bucket in your sink. When the bucket is full   you can use that water for lots of things. When its winter   take buckets of snow and melt it. Then you have buckets of water to use. When its summer   if you have a squirt gun   use water from a toy that has water in it. If theres anything leaking water   make sure to get it fixed right away. Dont buy water in a plastic container because plastic pollutes the Earth.

3,There are many kinds of squids. The giant deep-sea squid can be longer than a city bus   and they are cousins of the octopus. A squid has a long body and ten arms. They live in the Caribbean. The Squid protects itself by hiding.  A Squid can squirt out a blob of inky stuff. The inky blob may confuse hungry creatures. Its eggs come in handy because it surrounds itself with eggs and protects itself that way. Isnt this amazing that it can be camouflaged in one second? They hide by moving with  jet propulsion. If a shark tries to attack a squid   it will shoot out ink so it confuses the shark and zips away. Remember about the eggs? This is something like it. They swim together to protect themselves. They squirt out dark liquid to hide themselves from enemies. They change their colors and patterns to blend in with their surroundings.   Therefore you can see that the squid have many ways of hiding.  ,there be many kind of squid the giant deep sea squid can be long than a city bus and they be cousin of the octopus a squid have a long body and ten arm they live in the caribbean the squid protect itself by hide a squid can squirt out a blob of inky stuff the inky blob may confuse hungry creature it egg come in handy because it surround itself with egg and protect itself that way isnt this amazing that it can be camouflage in one second they hide by move with jet propulsion if a shark try to attack a squid it will shoot out ink so it confuse the shark and zip away remember about the egg this be something like it they swim together to protect themselves they squirt out dark liquid to hide themselves from enemy they change their color and pattern to blend in with their surroundings therefore you can see that the squid have many way of hiding,+ there are many kinds of squids . + the giant deep - sea squid can be longer than a city bus and they are cousins of the octopus .

3,The Abenaki lived in Vermont in the early 1600s. The Abenaki are a group of native people. They lived here much before you and me. They learned how to deal with the land. There were no houses   no electricity   not even heating. The land had hills   mountains   lots of trees   and rivers. Vermonts land affected the early Abenakis housing and their food.    Vermonts land affected the Abenakis housing. The Abenaki used young trees to build their houses. They cut them down and then bent them into a round roof. This kept the Abenaki warm in the winter because the roof kept the warmth in. Vermonts land also had lots of animals. They skinned the animals and took their sinews. The sinews held the saplings together. This helped the Abenaki people keep their houses stable. Vermonts land also had lots of trees. They used the bark from the trees to tie on the frame like shingles. That helped the Abenaki keep the rain out   so they stayed dry all the time. The Abenakis housing was greatly affected by the land.    Not only does the land affect the Abenakis housing   but it also affected the Abenakis food   too. The Abenaki women picked seeds in the forest. Then they planted them in some fresh soil. This helped the Abenaki because they had their own gardens   and they planted seeds   and soon they had food. Vermonts land also had a lot of fish. They killed the fish   and the dead fish helped fertilize the soil. That gave the Abenaki extra food. Vermonts land also had abundant wildlife. The Abenaki fished and hunted game. All of the fresh meat was shared among the whole village to keep everybody strong. The Abenakis food supply was affected by the land.    Vermonts land affected the early Abenakis housing and their food. The land seems to be a tough place to live   but the Abenaki respected the land and only took what they needed   and the land gave them what they needed.    ,the abenaki live in vermont in the early s the abenaki be a group of native people they live here much before you and me they learn how to deal with the land there be no house no electricity not even heat the land have hill mountains lot of tree and river vermont land affect the early abenaki housing and their food vermont land affect the abenaki housing the abenaki use young tree to build their house they cut them down and then bend them into a round roof this keep the abenaki warm in the winter because the roof keep the warmth in vermont land also have lot of animal they skin the animal and take their sinew the sinew hold the sapling together this help the abenaki people keep their house stable vermont land also have lot of tree they use the bark from the tree to tie on the frame like shingle that help the abenaki keep the rain out so they stay dry all the time the abenaki housing be greatly affect by the land not only do the land affect the abenakis housing but it also affect the abenakis food too the abenaki woman pick seed in the forest then they plant them in some fresh soil this help the abenaki because they have their own garden and they plant seed and soon they have food vermont land also have a lot of fish they kill the fish and the dead fish help fertilize the soil that give the abenaki extra food vermont land also have abundant wildlife the abenaki fish and hunt game all of the fresh meat be share among the whole village to keep everybody strong the abenaki food supply be affect by the land vermont land affect the early abenaki housing and their food the land seem to be a tough place to live but the abenaki respect the land and only take what they need and the land give them what they need,+ the + abenaki lived in + vermont in the early 1600s . + the + abenaki are a group of native people . + they lived here much before you and me . + they learned how to deal with the land . + there were no houses no electricity not even heating . + the land had hills mountains lots of trees and rivers . + vermonts land affected the early + abenakis housing and their food . + vermonts land affected the + abenakis housing . + the + abenaki used young trees to build their houses . + they cut them down and then bent them into a round roof . + this kept the + abenaki warm in the winter because the roof kept the warmth in . + vermonts land also had lots of animals . + they skinned the animals and took their sinews . + the sinews held the saplings together . + this helped the + abenaki people keep their houses stable . + vermonts land also had lots of trees . + they used the bark from the trees to tie on the frame like shingles . + that helped the + abenaki keep the rain out so they stayed dry all the time . + the + abenakis housing was greatly affected by the land . + not only does the land affect the + abenakis housing but it also affected the + abenakis food too . + the + abenaki women picked seeds in the forest . + then they planted them in some fresh soil . + this helped the + abenaki because they had their own gardens and they planted seeds and soon they had food . + vermonts land also had a lot of fish . + they killed the fish and the dead fish helped fertilize the soil . + that gave the + abenaki extra food . + vermonts land also had abundant wildlife . + the + abenaki fished and hunted game . + all of the fresh meat was shared among the whole village to keep everybody strong . + the + abenakis food supply was affected by the land . + vermonts land affected the early + abenakis housing and their food . + the land seems to be a tough place to live but the + abenaki respected the land and only took what they needed and the land gave them what they needed . 
4,Conserving water is a great way to help the Earth. Plants   humans   and animals would not be able to live without our water. We need to save water because we will eventually run out of it. Then we will have to use and drink salt water. It is extremely expensive to filter salt water. This is why we need save water. What can you do to save water?    One way you can save water is by getting a rain barrel. Rain barrels collect water so that you can water your plants with recycled water. Recycled water is better for plants because it is more natural. Recycled water also has good nutrients.    Another way you can save water is by getting an aerating faucet and showerhead. These items use less water but make it feel the same because they have more pressure. One more way you can save water is to make sure sprinklers are placed where they are watering the lawn in the summer.    One way my family saves water is by turning off the water when we brush our teeth. Water is the most important natural resource of all. Without water   we would die. If we ran out of water   as I said   we would die.

5,Learn about how Claudette Colvin helped the civil rights movement. Though most people dont know it   Rosa Parks was not the first black person to refuse to give up her seat. Claudette Colvin refused nine months before Rosa   in 1955. It was during segregation   and you would get arrested if you didnt let a white person sit down on a crowded bus while you stood. Segregation happened at lunch counters   in schoolsâ€”almost everywhere down south...  Claudette Colvin was important because she stood up for what she knew was right   and she motivated others. Who was Claudette?      She was a fifteen-year-old black girl. She went to Booker T. Washington High in Montgomery   Alabama. Her family was very poor   and her parents tried not to be noticed by white people because they didnt want to be arrestedâ€”the almost opposite of Martin Luther King Jr. She was a smart girl and hated segregation   especially the bus laws   because her family had no car and she had to sit in the back. She really wanted to be able to sit in the front ofâ€”or anywhere inâ€”the bus. You can tell that Claudette wanted to do something about the bus laws. What did she do? One thing she did was she refused to give up her seat. The law in Montgomery was that you had to give your seat up to a white person if there was no space for him or her. Claudette was still fifteen. One day   she was tired of having to get up   so she just stayed in her seat. The bus driver yelled at her   and soon police came and arrested her as she was kicking and screaming. She was very brave to stand up to the police. An NAACP lawyer named Fred Grey decided to go to the citys federal court to say that segregation laws were unconstitutional. He tried to find people who would go and talk about how the bus laws were unfair. Most people who had been mistreated were too scared of what might happen to their families. Only four blacks came to the hearing: Claudette and three older women. Claudette was very brave to go to court even though she knew the consequences. Whom did she motivate?      Nine months after Claudettes arrest   Mrs. Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat as well. On Monday   December fifth   Martin Luther King and other black leaders had black elementary and high schools pass out thirty-five thousand fliers saying Stay off the buses! That was the beginning of the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Though Claudette was not the reason for the bus boycott   she made black leaders realize that they needed to do the same thing   only using someone more experienced.      Why didnt black leaders use her? Though Claudette did refuse before Mrs. Parks   black leaders didnt want to start a bus boycott just because of a teenager. Also   she was hard to deal with because she swore a lot when the police took her off the bus   and black leaders didnt want that to happen in court or anything. The fact that she was poor didnt help either   and Claudette thought they didnt use her because she and her parents werent part of the inner circle   a group of more wealthy black people. The court case she went to is not very well known   so she is not recognized that way. Big history books dont even have a footnote about her. While she is not well known   she was still important to the civil rights movement.  e 1    Page 1      In conclusion   Claudette Colvin did what was right and motivated people. She was a big help to the civil rights movement because she motivated Rosa Parks and the black leaders to start the bus boycott. She helped when she went to the hearing because it ended segregation on buses. As Claudette said   Enough is enough! and at the time that was very true.     ,learn about how claudette colvin help the civil right movement though most people dont know it rosa park be not the first black person to refuse to give up her seat claudette colvin refuse nine month before rosa in it be during segregation and you would get arrest if you didnt let a white person sit down on a crowd bus while you stand segregation happen at lunch counter in school almost everywhere down south claudette colvin be important because she stand up for what she know be right and she motivate others who be claudette she be a fifteen year old black girl she go to booker t washington high in montgomery alabama her family be very poor and her parent try not to be notice by white people because they didnt want to be arrest the almost opposite of martin luther king jr she be a smart girl and hat segregation especially the bus law because her family have no car and she have to sit in the back she really want to be able to sit in the front of or anywhere in the bus you can tell that claudette want to do something about the bus law what do she do one thing she do be she refuse to give up her seat the law in montgomery be that you have to give your seat up to a white person if there be no space for him or her claudette be still fifteen one day she be tire of have to get up so she just stay in her seat the bus driver yell at her and soon police come and arrest her a she be kick and scream she be very brave to stand up to the police an naacp lawyer name fred grey decide to go to the citys federal court to say that segregation law be unconstitutional he try to find people who would go and talk about how the bus law be unfair most people who have be mistreat be too scar of what might happen to their family only four black come to the hearing claudette and three old woman claudette be very brave to go to court even though she know the consequence whom do she motivate nine month after claudettes arrest mr rosa park refuse to give up her seat as well on monday december fifth martin luther king and other black leader have black elementary and high school pass out thirty five thousand flier say stay off the bus that be the beginning of the montgomery bus boycott though claudette be not the reason for the bus boycott she make black leader realize that they need to do the same thing only use someone more experienced why didnt black leader use her though claudette do refuse before mr park black leader didnt want to start a bus boycott just because of a teenager also she be hard to deal with because she swear a lot when the police take her off the bus and black leader didnt want that to happen in court or anything the fact that she be poor didnt help either and claudette think they didnt use her because she and her parent werent part of the inner circle a group of more wealthy black people the court case she go to be not very well know so she be not recognize that way big history book dont even have a footnote about her while she be not well know she be still important to the civil right movement e page in conclusion claudette colvin do what be right and motivated people she be a big help to the civil right movement because she motivate rosa park and the black leader to start the bus boycott she help when she go to the hearing because it end segregation on bus a claudette say enough be enough and at the time that be very true,+ learn about how + claudette + colvin helped the civil rights movement . + though most people dont know it + rosa + parks was not the first black person to refuse to give up her seat . + claudette + colvin refused nine months before + rosa in 1955 . + it was during segregation and you would get arrested if you didnt let a white person sit down on a crowded bus while you stood . + segregation happened at lunch counters in schoolsalmost everywhere down south . . . + claudette + colvin was important because she stood up for what she knew was right and she motivated others . + who was + claudette ?

Her determination gave her the power to endure the emotions she had   and then gave her strength to carry on without her friend.    Another example is when Rifka  is in the hospital wing at Ellis Island. A doctor asks Rifka to take off her kerchief so he can check her for ringworm. Rifka realizes that if he finds something wrong with her she can be sent back to  Ukraine. She was so determined to get to America that she stood up to an American doctor. Other people that didnt have as much determination might not have done that because they would be too frightened to stand up to someone who could  send them back to their old country.    So as you can see   determination can get you anywhere. It got Rifka to America. How? It gave her the strength to carry on even though the obstacles were hard to overcome. Determination can help you achieve your goals too.,have you ever be determine to do something in the book letter from rifka the main character be determine to leave the ukraine to get to america rifka a year old girl be force to leave russia because if she doesnt she will be kill along the way she be determined and that determination help her to get to america rifka never give up hope in other word she have indomitable spirit in the beginning at the polish border when rifka get off the train the guard force her and her family to take off their clothes for the doctor they do this because the doctor want to see if she have a disease her determination enable her to stand there naked even though it be an uncomfortable humiliating situation another time be when she be on the ship to america she nearly drowns and lose a friend when a tempest hit she go into the hold which really smell after the storm end she look for her friend peter and learn that he have be lose at sea during the storm rifka return to her cabin in tear a few hour later when she hear people ooing and ahhing up on deck a the statue of liberty come into sight she realize she still want to go to america her determination give her the power to endure the emotion she have and then give her strength to carry on without her friend another example be when rifka be in the hospital wing at ellis island a doctor ask rifka to take off her kerchief so he can check her for ringworm rifka realize that if he find something wrong with her she can be send back to ukraine she be so determine to get to america that she stand up to an american doctor other people that didnt have as much determination might not have do that because they would be too frighten to stand up to someone who could send them back to their old country so a you can see determination can get you anywhere it get rifka to america how it give her the strength to carry on even though the obstacle be hard to overcome determination can help you achieve your goal too,+ have you ever been determined to do something ? + in the book + letters + from + rifka the main character was determined to leave the + ukraine to get to + america . + rifka a 12 year old girl is forced to leave + russia because if she doesnt she will be killed . + along the way she is determined and that determination helps her to get to + america . + rifka never gave up hope . + in other words she had indomitable spirit . + in the beginning at the + polish border when + rifka got off the train the guards force her and her family to take off their clothes for the + doctor . + they did this because the + doctor wanted to see if she had a disease . + her determination enabled her to stand there naked even though it was an uncomfortable humiliating situation . + another time was when she was on the ship to + america she nearly drowns and loses a friend when a tempest hit . + she goes into the hold which really smells . + after the storm ends she looks for her friend + peter and learns that he has been lost at sea during the storm . + rifka returns to her cabin in tears .

6,The Great Depression affected the people that lived through it in many ways. The things at I am going to explain are some of the things that affected the people who lived through the Great Depression. Having barely any money was one of the things that affected them. Also having less supplies affected them too. Having to take care of kids too also might have affected the people during the Great Depression.    First   I am going to talk about how having almost no money affected the people. It affected them because they were getting their money by working. Then their jobs were shutting down so their amount of money was shrinking and shrinking. They would do neighborhood favors and jobs but the amount of money they would get was five dollors. They also had to pay a bill for electricity every month. They had to pay for gas if you had a car and their house. That is why having almost no money affected them a lot.     Another reason the Great Depression affected the people was they were having less of the supplies they had. Like some of the people stopped delivery for several things such as milk and ice. They were also using less electricity and selling their cars. Those are some of supplies they had a shortage or had to not use as much.     Also if they had kids they would need to do extra work and be able to care for them. They also had to pay more money if they had kids because they have to feed them too. They also had to take care of them. The parents have to care for them. If they are sick they can not just leave them at home they have to take care of them. They also might worry about them. If you had kids during the Great Depression not only would you worry about your kids and family. That is why if you had kids during the Great Depression it might be more difficult.     Now you can see how living through the Great Depression was very difficult and affected many people who lived through it. It affected people in many ways like having no money or having a very little amount of it. Also if you had kids it might have been a little more difficult. They also had to live with less supplies. That is why I think the Great Depression affected the people who lived through it.,the great depression affect the people that live through it in many way the thing at i be go to explain be some of the thing that affect the people who live through the great depression have barely any money be one of the thing that affect them also have less supply affect them too have to take care of kid too also might have affect the people during the great depression first i be go to talk about how have almost no money affect the people it affect them because they be get their money by work then their job be shut down so their amount of money be shrink and shrink they would do neighborhood favor and job but the amount of money they would get be five dollors they also have to pay a bill for electricity every month they have to pay for gas if you have a car and their house that be why have almost no money affect them a lot another reason the great depression affect the people be they be have less of the supply they have like some of the people stop delivery for several thing such a milk and ice they be also use less electricity and sell their car those be some of supply they have a shortage or have to not use a much also if they have kid they would need to do extra work and be able to care for them they also have to pay more money if they have kid because they have to fee them too they also have to take care of them the parent have to care for them if they be sick they can not just leave them at home they have to take care of them they also might worry about them if you have kid during the great depression not only would you worry about your kid and family that be why if you have kid during the great depression it might be more difficult now you can see how living through the great depression be very difficult and affect many people who live through it it affect people in many way like have no money or have a very little amount of it also if you have kid it might have be a little more difficult they also have to live with less supply that be why i think the great depression affect the people who live through it,+ the + great + depression affected the people that lived through it in many ways . + the things at I am going to explain are some of the things that affected the people who lived through the + great + depression . + having barely any money was one of the things that affected them . + also having less supplies affected them too . + having to take care of kids too also might have affected the people during the + great + depression . + first I am going to talk about how having almost no money affected the people . + it affected them because they were getting their money by working . + then their jobs were shutting down so their amount of money was shrinking and shrinking . + they would do neighborhood favors and jobs but the amount of money they would get was five dollors . + they also had to pay a bill for electricity every month . + they had to pay for gas if you had a car and their house . + that is why having almost no money affected them a lot . + another reason the + great + depression affected the people was they were having less of the supplies they had . + like some of the people stopped delivery for several things such as milk and ice . + they were also using less electricity and selling their cars . + those are some of supplies they had a shortage or had to not use as much . + also if they had kids they would need to do extra work and be able to care for them . + they also had to pay more money if they had kids because they have to feed them too . + they also had to take care of them . + the parents have to care for them . + if they are sick they can not just leave them at home they have to take care of them . + they also might worry about them . + if you had kids during the + great + depression not only would you worry about your kids and family . + that is why if you had kids during the + great + depression it might be more difficult . + now you can see how living through the + great + depression was very difficult and affected many people who lived through it . + it affected people in many ways like having no money or having a very little amount of it . + also if you had kids it might have been a little more difficult . + they also had to live with less supplies . + that is why I think the + great + depression affected the people who lived through it . 
7,The Great Depression affected many people especially those who lived through it. With that said the main point of this essay is how people who lived through the Depression were affected during it.    During The Great Depression people had things to deal with that made them struggle. Some people didnt have an abundant amount of money not a decent amount. Insted they had little or none at all. It was a struggle to earn money with the lack of jobs   people ended up doing side jobs to earn money. In Digging In the family of four had to find ways to obtain money. They ended up cutting back on a lot of things like the water system and starting useing their well. The father did his best to get some type of income by doing side jobs   like cutting the boys hair for ___. People also looked to Rosevelt for help or  farming for a decent or better income. For instance in the poem Debts The family owned land that they used for farming. The father grew weat three years ago and hasnt been able to since. With scarce rain no wheat grew   without wheat to harvest no money would flow in. Bay   the father   even thought about getting a loan from Mr. Roosevelt   and he promised he didnt have to pay a dime till the crop came in. All he could do was hope things got better. Not only did people have things to worry about the President did too. In the artical The New Deal Rosevelt wanted to find a way to help the people suffering from the Great Depression. He created several ways to help with some of the issues. He made the NIRA and NRA   these systems banned child labor and adress unemployment by regulating the number of hours worked per week. The FERA gave $3 billion to states for work relief programs. In the end these systems only helped people take care of their basic needs.    The people who lived through the Great Depression had to find ways to obtain income   work and help. The Government did their best to support the people through this time but have you ever thought that this might happen again.,the great depression affect many people especially those who live through it with that say the main point of this essay be how people who live through the depression be affect during it during the great depression people have thing to deal with that make them struggle some people didnt have an abundant amount of money not a decent amount insted they have little or none at all it be a struggle to earn money with the lack of job people end up do side job to earn money in dig in the family of four have to find way to obtain money they end up cut back on a lot of thing like the water system and start use their well the father do his best to get some type of income by do side job like cut the boys hair for people also look to rosevelt for help or farming for a decent or good income for instance in the poem debts the family own land that they use for farm the father grow weat three year ago and hasnt be able to since with scarce rain no wheat grow without wheat to harvest no money would flow in bay the father even think about get a loan from mr roosevelt and he promise he didnt have to pay a dime till the crop come in all he could do be hope thing get well not only do people have thing to worry about the president do too in the artical the new deal rosevelt want to find a way to help the people suffer from the great depression he create several way to help with some of the issue he make the nira and nra these system ban child labor and adress unemployment by regulate the number of hour work per week the fera give billion to state for work relief program in the end these system only help people take care of their basic need the people who live through the great depression have to find way to obtain income work and help the government do their best to support the people through this time but have you ever think that this might happen again,+ the + great + depression affected many people especially those who lived through it . + with that said the main point of this essay is how people who lived through the + depression were affected during it . + during + the + great + depression people had things to deal with that made them struggle . + some people didnt have an abundant amount of money not a decent amount . + insted they had little or none at all . + it was a struggle to earn money with the lack of jobs people ended up doing side jobs to earn money . + in + digging + in the family of four had to find ways to obtain money . + they ended up cutting back on a lot of things like the water system and starting useing their well . + the father did his best to get some type of income by doing side jobs like cutting the boys hair for _ _ _ . + people also looked to + rosevelt for help or farming for a decent or better income . + for instance in the poem + debts + the family owned land that they used for farming . + the father grew weat three years ago and hasnt been able to since . + with scarce rain no wheat grew without wheat to harvest no money would flow in . + bay the father even thought about getting a loan from + mr . + roosevelt and he promised he didnt have to pay a dime till the crop came in . + all he could do was hope things got better . + not only did people have things to worry about the + president did too . + in the artical + the + new + deal + rosevelt wanted to find a way to help the people suffering from the + great + depression . + he created several ways to help with some of the issues . + he made the + nira and + nra these systems banned child labor and adress unemployment by regulating the number of hours worked per week . + the + fera gave $ 3 billion to states for work relief programs . + in the end these systems only helped people take care of their basic needs . + the people who lived through the + great + depression had to find ways to obtain income work and help . + the + government did their best to support the people through this time but have you ever thought that this might happen again . 
7,Jean Baptiste de Lamarck and Charles Darwin were both naturalists that had theories about organisms getting helpful variations. Lamarcks theory was called the theory of acquired characteristics and Darwins was called the theory of evolution by natural selection. Lamarck and Darwins theories are the same and different in some ways.    Darwin and Lamarcks theories were very different. Darwin theory said that organisms get helpful variation before changes in the environment. He thought they got the variation by chance at birth. He explained that the reason giraffes had long necks was because some giraffes had a variation which was a longer neck. The giraffes with short necks could only get food on the ground so they had to compete for it so they died. The giraffes with the long necks did not have to compete because they could get the food up high and they survived and passed the long necks onto their young.  Lamarck theory said that organisms got helpful variation after  a change in the environment. He said that giraffes got long necks when the food on the ground ran out. The giraffes needed to eat food and there was food up high so they stretched out their necks. They then passed it on to their young. Their theories are different because Lamarck thought that organisms changed out of need and after a change in the environment and Darwin thought organisms changed by chance when they were born and before there was a change in the environment.    Darwin and Lamarcks theories were very different but they were also very similar. They both thought that organisms changed. They thought these changes could be very useful and could help them survive. The changes could then get passed down to the young. That is how Lamarck and Darwins theories are similar.

7,One of the most important things in life is to know how to build a successful fire. For ages fire has been a critical part of our lives. Fire provides heat   and this is what it is mainly used for. Heat cooks food. This is also critical because some uncooked foods can cause some very nasty   unmentionable diseases. And   of course   there is aesthetics. Could one be more cheerful than roasting chesnuts over an open fire?    So   now that youre all convinced that fire is the greatest thing in the world   you probably should know how to make a successful fire. Well   I agree wholeheartedly to teaching you. So   let us go through the steps one by one.     First you need to decide where you are going to build the fire   whether it be in a woodstove   in a fireplace   or out in the open. They are all relatively the same in terms of process   but materials used can differ. The basic process is as follows.    First you need to find some newspaper   or other easily burnt materials such as birch bark   office papers   old report cards   etc. Crumple up enough of the paper to cover the bottom of your fire area (if you are using birch bark just lay a few strips down). Next you need kindling. Kindling usually is best in the form of split boards   but split wood is also fine as long as the wood is dry and not green (not in color but if wood has been cut recently it is usually referred to as green). About four to eight pieces should be laid on top of the paper in a criss-cross design in order to allow the fire air. See Figure 1. Note: Fire will not burn without oxygen! Do not smother it!  Then you need a small piece of firewood   preferably not green. This should be laid diagonally across the top of the kindling.    Well   thats the hard part. Now you just need a match. Light the paper (or bark) in a few places and watch the fire blaze. Note: The wood will need to be replenished now and then. Just lay a piece of firewood across the top of the currently burning log and it will soon start blazing Enjoy your wonderful fire wherever you are!    I hope that if you survive your first fire you will continue to use this wonderful power of nature safely so that all can enjoy it. And remember   â€˜only YOU can prevent forest fires!  ,one of the most important thing in life be to know how to build a successful fire for age fire have be a critical part of our life fire provide heat and this be what it be mainly use for heat cook food this be also critical because some uncooked food can cause some very nasty unmentionable disease and of course there be aesthetic could one be more cheerful than roast chesnuts over an open fire so now that youre all convince that fire be the great thing in the world you probably should know how to make a successful fire well i agree wholeheartedly to teach you so let u go through the step one by one first you need to decide where you be go to build the fire whether it be in a woodstove in a fireplace or out in the open they be all relatively the same in term of process but material use can differ the basic process be a follow first you need to find some newspaper or other easily burnt material such a birch bark office paper old report card etc crumple up enough of the paper to cover the bottom of your fire area if you be use birch bark just lay a few strip down next you need kindle kindle usually be best in the form of split board but split wood be also fine as long a the wood be dry and not green not in color but if wood have be cut recently it be usually refer to a green about four to eight piece should be lay on top of the paper in a criss cross design in order to allow the fire air see figure note fire will not burn without oxygen do not smother it then you need a small piece of firewood preferably not green this should be lay diagonally across the top of the kindle well thats the hard part now you just need a match light the paper or bark in a few place and watch the fire blaze note the wood will need to be replenish now and then just lay a piece of firewood across the top of the currently burn log and it will soon start blaze enjoy your wonderful fire wherever you be i hope that if you survive your first fire you will continue to use this wonderful power of nature safely so that all can enjoy it and remember only you can prevent forest fire,+ one of the most important things in life is to know how to build a successful fire . + for ages fire has been a critical part of our lives . + fire provides heat and this is what it is mainly used for . + heat cooks food . + this is also critical because some uncooked foods can cause some very nasty unmentionable diseases . + and of course there is aesthetics . + could one be more cheerful than roasting chesnuts over an open fire ? + so now that youre all convinced that fire is the greatest thing in the world you probably should know how to make a successful fire . + well I agree wholeheartedly to teaching you . + so let us go through the steps one by one . + first you need to decide where you are going to build the fire whether it be in a woodstove in a fireplace or out in the open . + they are all relatively the same in terms of process but materials used can differ . + the basic process is as follows . + first you need to find some newspaper or other easily burnt materials such as birch bark office papers old report cards etc . + crumple up enough of the paper to cover the bottom of your fire area ( if you are using birch bark just lay a few strips down ) . + next you need kindling . + kindling usually is best in the form of split boards but split wood is also fine as long as the wood is dry and not green ( not in color but if wood has been cut recently it is usually referred to as green ) . + about four to eight pieces should be laid on top of the paper in a criss - cross design in order to allow the fire air . + see + figure 1 . + note : + fire will not burn without oxygen ! + do not smother it ! + then you need a small piece of firewood preferably not green . + this should be laid diagonally across the top of the kindling . + well thats the hard part . + now you just need a match . + light the paper ( or bark ) in a few places and watch the fire blaze . + note : + the wood will need to be replenished now and then . + just lay a piece of firewood across the top of the currently burning log and it will soon start blazing + enjoy your wonderful fire wherever you are !

8,This notorious event put Americas hope to the test   leaving Americans economically and mentally drained. The Great Depression devastated America and will never be forgotten. If not for Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his beneficial New Deal   who knows what horrid ruins would remain as a result of The Great Depression?     With no dependable income   we cut back on everything possible. This excerpt from the story Digging In by Robert J. Hastings shows the situation that each and every American faced. In the story   it is said that the family substituted toothpaste and toilet paper for soda and catalog pages. Even common necessities had to be sacrificed during the Great Depression.    Along with their wallets   Americans spirits were also crushed. In the poem Debts by Karen Hesse   the father of the family faces a serious drought but still believes in rain. When reality sets in that rain is not likely to come   he is filled with rage and leaves to *** to the farm to avoid feuding with his pregnant wife. This man was a farmer and had to rely on the most unreliable thing for a source of income   Mother Nature. This man and every other Americans spirits were tested during the Great Depression   and the number of those who still had hope was constantly diminishing. With America facing economic doom   Americans turned to one man - Franklin Delano Roosevelt. With the promise of a New Deal to help end the Great Depression   Roosevelt won the election by a landslide. He created jobs for three million single men between seventeen and twenty-three years of age. Roosevelts work relief program put eight and a half million Americans to work building roads   bridges   airports and more. Although Roosevelt did not end the Great Depression   he provided Americans with work and hope.     The Great Depression left Americans mentally as well as economically depleted. This event tested the will of the American people and left some citizens without any hope. With the help of Franklin Delano Roosevelt   America was able to get through the Great Depression with dignity and hope.       ,this notorious event put americas hope to the test leave american economically and mentally drain the great depression devastate america and will never be forget if not for franklin delano roosevelt and his beneficial new deal who know what horrid ruin would remain a a result of the great depression with no dependable income we cut back on everything possible this excerpt from the story digging in by robert j hastings show the situation that each and every american face in the story it be say that the family substitute toothpaste and toilet paper for soda and catalog page even common necessity have to be sacrifice during the great depression along with their wallet americans spirit be also crush in the poem debt by karen hesse the father of the family face a serious drought but still believe in rain when reality set in that rain be not likely to come he be fill with rage and leave to to the farm to avoid feud with his pregnant wife this man be a farmer and have to rely on the most unreliable thing for a source of income mother nature this man and every other american spirit be test during the great depression and the number of those who still have hope be constantly diminish with america face economic doom american turn to one man franklin delano roosevelt with the promise of a new deal to help end the great depression roosevelt win the election by a landslide he create job for three million single men between seventeen and twenty three year of age roosevelt work relief program put eight and a half million american to work building road bridge airport and more although roosevelt do not end the great depression he provide american with work and hope the great depression leave american mentally as well a economically deplete this event test the will of the american people and leave some citizen without any hope with the help of franklin delano roosevelt america be able to get through the great depression with dignity and hope,+ this notorious event put + americas hope to the test leaving + americans economically and mentally drained . + the + great + depression devastated + america and will never be forgotten . + if not for + franklin + delano + roosevelt and his beneficial + new + deal who knows what horrid ruins would remain as a result of + the + great + depression ? + with no dependable income we cut back on everything possible . + this excerpt from the story + digging + in by + robert J . + hastings shows the situation that each and every + american faced . + in the story it is said that the family substituted toothpaste and toilet paper for soda and catalog pages . + even common necessities had to be sacrificed during the + great + depression . + along with their wallets + americans spirits were also crushed . + in the poem + debts by + karen + hesse the father of the family faces a serious drought but still believes in rain . + when reality sets in that rain is not likely to come he is filled with rage and leaves to *** to the farm to avoid feuding with his pregnant wife . + this man was a farmer and had to rely on the most unreliable thing for a source of income + mother + nature . + this man and every other + americans spirits were tested during the + great + depression and the number of those who still had hope was constantly diminishing . + with + america facing economic doom + americans turned to one man - + franklin + delano + roosevelt . + with the promise of a + new + deal to help end the + great + depression + roosevelt won the election by a landslide . + he created jobs for three million single men between seventeen and twenty - three years of age . + roosevelts work relief program put eight and a half million + americans to work building roads bridges airports and more . + although + roosevelt did not end the + great + depression he provided + americans with work and hope . + the + great + depression left + americans mentally as well as economically depleted . + this event tested the will of the + american people and left some citizens without any hope . + with the help of + franklin + delano + roosevelt + america was able to get through the + great + depression with dignity and hope . 
8,Have you ever looked at your own cells? No   of course not. Youre a mortal and you dont have the power or technology to do that. Maybe some day in the future we shall grant humans the power of microscopic vision. Who knows? Thats up to Zeus. Cells are amazing things. Each one is individually different. When I first looked at my own cells I thought   WOW there is nothing like this in the whole world. I was wrong. Recently   I came to the realization that my own dear Mount Olympus is very much like a cell itself. There are many components in a cells that can also   in a way   be found on Mount Olympus. The structure of a cell and the components within are very like Mount Olympus. What? You dont believe me? Well fine! Come on. Ill show you. Oh   and by the way my name is Eos and Im the Greek goddess of dawn. Im responsible for the rising of the sun. Be careful and follow me. Dont let anyone else see you. Mortals arent allowed up her. Lets go.    In an animal cell   the cell membrane controls what enters and leaves the cell. There are small pores that allow things of different sizes through. Up her   on Olympus what keeps the mortals from entering. or leaving (if they are to be kept here) is an instilled fear of us. Mortals dare not enter unless told to by one of the gods or goddesses. They dare not leave either.    Now   all of you stand still. No   its okay. This is just a powder that will make you invisible. Nobody move or make a sound. Got it? If you do   it will be your life wasted. I just have to check to make sure that neither Zeus or Hera are in their throne roomâ€¦Okay   we can go in. Just go silently and quickly! This is Zeus and Heras throne room   which is very similar to the nucleus of a cell. In a cell   the nucleus is the control center of activity on a cellular level. Its from here that Zeus and Hera control the happenings of immortals and mortals alike. Its like the control center for the world.    Holy Zeus! Someones coming in. Its Zeus himself! Quick into here. No noise   no movement   no nothing! Those of you who can peer through the window   do so. Youll be able to see the head god himself! Zeus and his wife   Hera   control the gods   goddesses   and mortals. They are like the chromosomes in a cell. In a cell   the chromosomes determine what kind of cell it will be and how it acts. That is what Zeus and Hera do in the world.  In a cell   the ribosomes turn amino acids into proteins. On Mount Olympus we make many things like laws   rules   and the weather. However   the most material thing that we make are lightning bolts. Of course   only Zeus can actually make them. Although others can use them if they have his permission. See how Zeus only uses his left hand for tasks? That is because his right hand is used to make lightening. Like the ribosomes   his hand takes raw materials (the abundant plasma and energy up here) and creates a whole new product (lightning.) His hand is like a the ribosomes in a cell.    Good   Zeus is leaving. This closet is starting to get stuffy. We should go quickly out into the hall. Now take a right   then a left into here. This is the courtyard. Immortals dont have to eat   but we do it for the pleasure of it. Also   eating helps keep us healthy and happy. The fountains flow with sweet juices and wines. The trees have the best fruits possible. That table over there is always supplied with the most delectable food imaginable.  Those chests that are spread around are filled with gold and jewels for our taking. Wearing these helps enhance our godly image. This courtyard represents the vacuoles in a cell. In the vacuoles   large amounts of what the cell needs are stored. Here large amounts of what immortals thrive on is stored.  Dont be alarmed. Those are our mortal slaves. They wont tell on us because I have ordered them not to. In an animal cell   mitochondria store energy and release it when necessary. They power the cell. Here on Mount Olympus   we could not get by with out thee slaves. They perform almost every task that can even slight be considered laborious. The energy they get from food is stored in their bodies and released in order to do tasks.  In a cell   the ER   or endoplasmic reticulum   help to move substances around the cell. The halls and paths weve been following are very similar to the ER   they are like the roads that contain all movement.  Quick   into this room here. That was Hermes the messenger god. Now that I think of it   he is very much like the golgi bodies in a cell. The golgi bodies package and ship substances from place to place in a cell. Hermes   similarly wraps items up in goat skin and takes them from one person   immortal   or Titan to another.  Now   lets go back to the entrance. You should go. Soon every god   goddess   demi-god   and demi-goddess will be coming. There is a big meeting tonight. So they were all summoned here. By now   Im sure you can see how Mount Olympus is structured like a cell Just follow that path down there until you get home. Wait   the day is almost over and itll get dark. Each of you swallow some of this powder. There   this enables you to fly   which is much faster than walking. If you promise not to tell anyone about this and you can go. You swear?

9,During the Great Depression   millions of people lost jobs   and families struggled to find financial footholds. It lasted for ten years   leaving very strong memories of dramatically dark times. Throughout those years   people found new ways to cope with the struggles   and interestingly enough   new emotions and belief in the ideals of America. Everybody learned the importance of being resourceful   while also keeping hope for the future and growing more unified and patriotic as a country.    One important effect of the Great Depression was how it made people and families resourceful. That quality is largely a part of the memoir Digging In   where a man who lived during the Depression talked about his familys frugalness   and how they had to cut back on everything possible in order to save money. Some of the things they had to cut back on included city water   selling their car   and discontinuing purchases of toothpaste   toilet paper   and snacks   just to name a few. They also took care of what [they] had   and listed all the ways they used a cotton cloth   which included using it as a dish cloth   bandage   quilt piece and more. These qualities of being frugal and resourceful werent bad; they taught people to not be wasteful and to not spend money on things that arent necessary. Being resourceful became a part of life during the Depression as a way to help families stay financially afloat.    More significantly the Great Depression   in a broad sense   brought a sense of patriotism and more unity as a country. Former President Franklin D. Roosevelt enriched his second inaugural address with these ideals. He said that the greatest change he had witnessed was the change in the moral climate of America and that they were on the road of progress. Another quote of his was in seeking for economic and political progress as a nation   we all go up   or else we all go down   as one people. What Roosevelt was implying was if the people wanted their country to go in the right direction   they all had to work together. Working together wouldnt be hard   due to the entire countrys new sense of belief in their country   also known as patriotism. The United States stronger sense of unity that came about during the depression helped citizens work through the hard times.     Most importantly   the Depression oddly enough brought a sense of hope. In some cases   farmers had to keep hope for the future and that it would bring rain for their crops so they could get money   as a farmer had in a poem called Debts. In an article about The New Deal   on explanation was given about how Roosevelt gave the country hope by creating many reforms that were aimed to relieve poverty   reduce unemployment   and speed economic recovery. This hope for the future gave people something worth living for during times when suicide didnt seem like a bad idea. Indeed   this sense of hope was a very important effect that the Great Depression had on the people who lived through it.    Even though the Depression devastatingly affected tens of millions of people   the way it changed peoples outlooks was inspiring. Instead of tossing a cotton bag in the garbage   people learned to be resourceful and used them as towels and dish cloths. A stronger sense of pride in their country helped them work through the hardships together   with patriotism and unity. Above all else   without hope for the future   people wouldve given up on trying to fix their severely wounded economy. These enhanced senses of resourcefulness   unity   along with patriotism and hope were all ways that the Great Depression affected Americans.     ,during the great depression million of people lose job and family struggle to find financial foothold it last for ten year leave very strong memory of dramatically dark time throughout those year people find new way to cope with the struggle and interestingly enough new emotion and belief in the ideal of america everybody learn the importance of be resourceful while also keep hope for the future and grow more unified and patriotic a a country one important effect of the great depression be how it make people and family resourceful that quality be largely a part of the memoir digging in where a man who live during the depression talk about his family frugalness and how they have to cut back on everything possible in order to save money some of the thing they have to cut back on include city water sell their car and discontinue purchase of toothpaste toilet paper and snack just to name a few they also take care of what they have and list all the way they use a cotton cloth which include use it a a dish cloth bandage quilt piece and more these quality of be frugal and resourceful werent bad they teach people to not be wasteful and to not spend money on thing that arent necessary be resourceful become a part of life during the depression a a way to help family stay financially afloat more significantly the great depression in a broad sense bring a sense of patriotism and more unity a a country former president franklin d roosevelt enrich his second inaugural address with these ideal he say that the great change he have witness be the change in the moral climate of america and that they be on the road of progress another quote of his be in seek for economic and political progress a a nation we all go up or else we all go down as one people what roosevelt be imply be if the people want their country to go in the right direction they all have to work together work together wouldnt be hard due to the entire country new sense of belief in their country also know a patriotism the united state strong sense of unity that come about during the depression help citizen work through the hard time most importantly the depression oddly enough bring a sense of hope in some case farmer have to keep hope for the future and that it would bring rain for their crop so they could get money a a farmer have in a poem call debt in an article about the new deal on explanation be give about how roosevelt give the country hope by create many reform that be aim to relieve poverty reduce unemployment and speed economic recovery this hope for the future give people something worth living for during time when suicide didnt seem like a bad idea indeed this sense of hope be a very important effect that the great depression have on the people who live through it even though the depression devastatingly affect ten of million of people the way it change people outlook be inspire instead of toss a cotton bag in the garbage people learn to be resourceful and use them a towel and dish cloth a strong sense of pride in their country help them work through the hardship together with patriotism and unity above all else without hope for the future people wouldve give up on try to fix their severely wound economy these enhanced sens of resourcefulness unity along with patriotism and hope be all way that the great depression affect american,+ during the + great + depression millions of people lost jobs and families struggled to find financial footholds . + it lasted for ten years leaving very strong memories of dramatically dark times . + throughout those years people found new ways to cope with the struggles and interestingly enough new emotions and belief in the ideals of + america . + everybody learned the importance of being resourceful while also keeping hope for the future and growing more unified and patriotic as a country . + one important effect of the + great + depression was how it made people and families resourceful . + that quality is largely a part of the memoir + digging + in where a man who lived during the + depression talked about his familys frugalness and how they had to cut back on everything possible in order to save money . + some of the things they had to cut back on included city water selling their car and discontinuing purchases of toothpaste toilet paper and snacks just to name a few . + they also took care of what [ they ] had and listed all the ways they used a cotton cloth which included using it as a dish cloth bandage quilt piece and more . + these qualities of being frugal and resourceful werent bad ;

9,A long piercing howl shatters the quiet night of a northern forest.  The howl grows into a chorus of yelps and barks   and the valley echos to the chilling sound.  The leader of the pack starts the noise   while other pack members   as well as other wolf packs   join in (OToole 22).    Among wolves   communication is a very highly developed skill.  For instance   the howl of the pack leader has many different meanings.  Most of the time a lone howl is a warning for other packs.  It tells them to stay away   for there are many young to be protected and food to be guarded (OToole 23).  A howl can also be a way of marking their territory.  Many wolves howl when they feel another pack is too close.  Some wolves howl when they are lost or trying to find another member of the pack.  Most wolves use this howl at least once a day to locate missing pups or other pack members (Primate).    To wolves   the territory that they occupy (the territory of some packs may cover 20-120 square miles) is like a house to a human being. They feel that they must protect it all times   and   other packs must not trespass.  Neighboring packs may share up to a mile of territory   but rarely will they share more than that (Primate).  All wolves know that if they run through another packs territory   they run the risk of being killed (Primate).  In addition   wolves mark their territory by scent (mostly urine).  This helps all wolves know where their territory begins.    Like humans   the wolf has three main avenues of communication   postural (body language); vocal (the howl or snarl); and olfactory (scent) (Wolfhaven).  The scent is the most commonly used   and probably the most important.  Besides marking territory   it helps show food ownership   as well as acting as a road map for themselves.  Wolves also have scent glands between their toes   which leaves their scent wherever they go (Primate).      Moreover   much communication is done through body language.  Many postures have been evolved to reduce conflict and aggression among pack members.  Facial expressions are the most obvious.  Generally   bared teeth with ears erect and pointed back can indicate a threat by a dominant male (Wolfhaven).  In contrast   a closed mouth   slitlike eyes   and ears pulled forward (and close to their head) will most likely indicate subordinate behavior (Wolfhaven).  Wolves also use their tail position to communicate emotion.  Threatening wolves hold their tails high   almost perpendicular   while more submissive wolves lower themselves before dominant pack members.  These lower class members often have their tails tucked between their legs (Primate).  A wolf that has been defeated in a fight can avoid being attacked by its victorious companion by taking a posture similar to that of a pup begging for food (University of Oklahoma Press 91).    Wolves must communicate at all times when they are hunting.  They have to work together to catch most of their food (due to the size of the food that they hunt).  The concept that wolves use is called the Pincer Attack (Baily 91).  When using the pincer attack   the pack splits in two groups and surround the prey (mostly deer   sheep   and other medium-sized mammals).  One of the groups causes a diversion   while the other half ambushes the helpless prey.  Wolves can move quickly and quietly.  Many of them operate on stamina rather then on sudden bursts of speed (Baily 85).  Because of the cooperation of the group   when it comes to hunting   the pack usually ends up victorious   and they have enough food for a couple of days.  If they pack gets a big kill   then the leader will have the next strongest male guard the kill during the night to keep off other animals.    Like other animals   wolves communicate with a social ladder.  They have one dominant male (usually the leader of the pack) (Primate).  This wolf has many responsibilities.  He has to make sure that all the other wolves dont get out of line   and makes sure that there is harmony among the group.  The pack leader does this by barking at the other wolves and fighting with the other males.  Normally   the pack leader will not fight with the females of the pack unless it is necessary (Timberwolf).  With the leader comes a dominant female.  Together they are known as the breeding  pair.  These two are in charge of the pack   raising the young   selecting denning areas and rendezvous sites   capturing food   and maintaining the packs territory (Primate).  These two wolves are also responsible for the offspring.  Not many of the other wolves mate for offspring because that is the dominant pairs job.  Every year the dominant pair will produce one litter of pups.  These pups take the place of the older wolves that are too old to hunt.  Because the pack is so close and they communicate all the time   many of the other female wolves help the dominant female with taking care of the young (Wolfhaven).  The dominant female will assign each pup to an older female.  This helps the other females learn how to be a mother   and it helps the dominant female so she can hunt and not have to worry about taking care of her young.    If only humans could communicate as well as wolves   todays society would be wonderful.  Wolves methods of communication are simple and usually resolve conflicts without violence.  Wolves have been living together for many   many years so they must  be doing something right.  Maybe we can learn something from the wolves instead of trying to make them extinct.  ,a long piercing howl shatter the quiet night of a northern forest the howl grow into a chorus of yelp and bark

A howl can also be a way of marking their territory . + many wolves howl when they feel another pack is too close . + some wolves howl when they are lost or trying to find another member of the pack . + most wolves use this howl at least once a day to locate missing pups or other pack members ( + primate ) . + to wolves the territory that they occupy ( the territory of some packs may cover 20 - 120 square miles ) is like a house to a human being . + they feel that they must protect it all times and other packs must not trespass . + neighboring packs may share up to a mile of territory but rarely will they share more than that ( + primate ) . + all wolves know that if they run through another packs territory they run the risk of being killed ( + primate ) . + in addition wolves mark their territory by scent ( mostly urine ) . + this helps all wolves know where their territory begins . + like humans the wolf has three main avenues of communication postural ( body language ) ; vocal ( the howl or snarl ) ; and olfactory ( scent ) ( + wolfhaven ) . + the scent is the most commonly used and probably the most important . + besides marking territory it helps show food ownership as well as acting as a road map for themselves . + wolves also have scent glands between their toes which leaves their scent wherever they go ( + primate ) . + moreover much communication is done through body language . + many postures have been evolved to reduce conflict and aggression among pack members . + facial expressions are the most obvious . + generally bared teeth with ears erect and pointed back can indicate a threat by a dominant male ( + wolfhaven ) . + in contrast a closed mouth slitlike eyes and ears pulled forward ( and close to their head ) will most likely indicate subordinate behavior ( + wolfhaven ) . + wolves also use their tail position to communicate emotion . + threatening wolves hold their tails high almost perpendicular while more submissive wolves lower themselves before dominant pack members . + these lower class members often have their tails tucked between their legs ( + primate ) . A wolf that has been defeated in a fight can avoid being attacked by its victorious companion by taking a posture similar to that of a pup begging for food ( + university of + oklahoma + press 91 ) . + wolves must communicate at all times when they are hunting . + they have to work together to catch most of their food ( due to the size of the food that they hunt ) . + the concept that wolves use is called the + pincer + attack ( + baily 91 ) . + when using the pincer attack the pack splits in two groups and surround the prey ( mostly deer sheep and other medium - sized mammals ) . + one of the groups causes a diversion while the other half ambushes the helpless prey . + wolves can move quickly and quietly . + many of them operate on stamina rather then on sudden bursts of speed ( + baily 85 ) . + because of the cooperation of the group when it comes to hunting the pack usually ends up victorious and they have enough food for a couple of days . + if they pack gets a big kill then the leader will have the next strongest male guard the kill during the night to keep off other animals . + like other animals wolves communicate with a social ladder . + they have one dominant male ( usually the leader of the pack ) ( + primate ) . + this wolf has many responsibilities . + he has to make sure that all the other wolves dont get out of line and makes sure that there is harmony among the group . + the pack leader does this by barking at the other wolves and fighting with the other males . + normally the pack leader will not fight with the females of the pack unless it is necessary ( + timberwolf ) . + with the leader comes a dominant female . + together they are known as the breeding pair . + these two are in charge of the pack raising the young selecting denning areas and rendezvous sites capturing food and maintaining the packs territory ( + primate ) . + these two wolves are also responsible for the offspring . + not many of the other wolves mate for offspring because that is the dominant pairs job . + every year the dominant pair will produce one litter of pups . + these pups take the place of the older wolves that are too old to hunt . + because the pack is so close and they communicate all the time many of the other female wolves help the dominant female with taking care of the young ( + wolfhaven ) . + the dominant female will assign each pup to an older female . + this helps the other females learn how to be a mother and it helps the dominant female so she can hunt and not have to worry about taking care of her young . + if only humans could communicate as well as wolves todays society would be wonderful . + wolves methods of communication are simple and usually resolve conflicts without violence . + wolves have been living together for many many years so they must be doing something right . + maybe we can learn something from the wolves instead of trying to make them extinct . 
10,Life is difficult. Sometimes   it is devastatingly so. Yet the human race can be defined by the dual characteristics of perseverance and hope. We   the human race   are the infamous turtle of Steinbecks Grapes of Wrath   we take each obstacle in stride and keep on going on. The Great Depression is one of the best examples of humankinds tendency towards both perseverance and hope. The fact that so many people managed to live through the terrible poverty of the Great Depression is a testament to the tenacity of hope and optimism in humans   and Americans in particular.    The texts provided for this analysis all discuss the Great Depression and its effects on the people who lived through it. On the whole   the theme translated from the texts is that the people who survived the Great Depression developed   as a direct result of the Depression   a curiously strong sense of optimism. President Franklin D. Roosevelt   in his Second Inaugural Address   attributes this sense of optimism to democracy   and its ...innate capacity to protect its people against disasters once considered inevitable   to solve problems once considered unsolvable. Roosevelt is   of course   making a blunt reference to his popular and effective programs under the New Deal. It is true that the New Deal had come at just the right moment   and that millions of people were helped through the New Deal   particularly the WPA   or Works Progress Administration   which was   as put in the fourth source from PBS   a major work relief program...[employing] more than 8.5 million people to build bridges   roads   public buildings   parks and airports. 8.5 million people is a lot of people to employ   and based upon these facts alone it would seem that the New Deal was indeed reason to hope.    Yet the other sources   and indeed even later on in Roosevelts speech   indicate that such hope was perhaps misplaced   at least in the extent that the hope was placed upon Roosevelt. In Digging In   the second source written by Robert J. Hastings   the narrator reflects on her fathers efforts to get money: it was a days work here and a days work there...a few days on the WPA... Thus   it seems that although the WPA may have employed 8.5 million people   it was not by any means a source of income   if people were only able to work for a few days at a time. However   the focus of Digging In is not to evaluate federal programs   but to evaluate the effectiveness of ones own efforts to help oneself. More than anything   the lengths to which the narrators family went in order to save money exemplifies   once again   an incredible amount of perseverance. From the selling of the car   to the renouncement of milk and ice   the family maintains their perseverance and their hope. Towards the end of the passage   the narrators mother speaks of this imperative hope: Ive learned that whatever happens   your Daddy always has a little dab of money put back somewhere... Whether or not this was true   it certainly seems to be a sentiment that enabled the family to maintain their sanity     In Roosevelts speech   there is a section in which he employs anaphora to give emphasis to the negative effects of the Depression by repeating   for several lines   I see... followed by a sad image   thought   or idea. He finishes the anaphora with I see one-third of a nation ill-housed   ill-clad   ill-nourished. While this rhetorical emphasis is used mainly to lead into his positive images to follow   in order to be more convincing towards his audience   the negative scenes which he describes were not only rhetorical   but quite real. People were homeless and clotheless and foodless during the Great Depression   millions of them. That is why it is so incredible that the primary effect of such a tragedy was to create a generation of hopeful people. Such hope is characterized in the first source   a poem by Karen Hesse entitled Debts. In this poem   the narrator describes that Daddy is thinking/ of taking a loan from Mr. Roosevelt and his men... This connection to the New Deal emphasizes that the government   through President Roosevelt   helped instigate the massive flood of hope in the American people. The dad in the poem wants to buy wheat even though such an idea is completely impractical; the dad is a naively hopeful character.    As the Ma says in the last phrase of the poem   well   it rains enough...to keep a person hoping./But even if it didnt/your daddy would have to believe. This quote defines succinctly the mind-set amongst Americans living in the Depression that hope will lead to greatness. Perhaps this was because Americans could do nothing else but hope   and work   and trust in the leaders of their country. It is human nature   after all   to do everything one can to keep oneself going. Thus   the Depression imprinted a sense of hope on the people that lived through it. It is a sense of hope that has not been witnessed to the same extent in our time   yet hope continues to persevere in humans.   ,life be difficult sometimes it be devastatingly so yet the human race can be define by the dual characteristic of perseverance and hope we the human race be the infamous turtle of steinbeck grape of wrath we take each obstacle in stride and keep on go on the great

people to build bridge roads public building park and airport million people be a lot of people to employ and base upon these fact alone it would seem that the new deal be indeed reason to hope yet the other source and indeed even later on in roosevelt speech indicate that such hope be perhaps misplace at least in the extent that the hope be place upon roosevelt in dig in the second source write by robert j hastings the narrator reflect on her father effort to get money it be a day work here and a day work there a few day on the wpa thus it seem that although the wpa may have employ million

10,Looking at this ad   who would guess that those golden arches bring home approximately fourteen billion dollars a year customers worldwide? Who would guess that McDonalds is the worlds leading food organization and employs over 28 000 workers in 120 different countries? The ad is   in fact   an image of a completely different nature. It is a calm   nostalgic looking ad; nothing in the peaceful summer scene hints that McDonalds has or ever will represent anything other than quality family living.    The characters in the ad are strategically positioned to inspire within the viewer   feelings of fun and familiarity. The picture located at the center of the page   depicts an older woman with a little girlâ€”perhaps her granddaughterâ€”beside her. The two are lying on their stomachs   propped up by elbows in the sand. Neither looks up as the camera clicks   catching them at play. The little girl giggles as her tiger toy leaps over the walls of her castle made of sand. Her grandmother looks on with a knowing smile   perhaps remembering the days when she used to play such innocent games. The sun shines down on their backs and speckles the older womans face through her woven sunhat. Behind   their legs are crossed at the ankles in carefree swingâ€”the girl in imitation of her clearly admirable grandmother. They have obviously been to this beach before   and are having the time of their lives.    As with the characters   the placement of the props in the ad is very significant. The slightly unfocused images of the beach gear on their right are clearly placed as a backdrop   almost as a side noteâ€”not directly related to the McDonalds message about family values   but still essential. The responsible grandmother planned ahead and brought along all they might need for a day on the beach   but does not need to broadcast it to the viewer. In the far corner   an umbrella stands shading their picnic blanket; beside the grandmothers arm is a pair of sunglasses   and upon her head rests a hat to protect her from the sun. Oh   and whats that in the corner? Ah yes   the McDonalds Happy Meal they picked up on their way. Cheeseburgers with french-fries is far from the healthiest picnic Grandma could have brought for her granddaughter   but what does that matter? Theyre spending time together.    The summer scene in black and white instantly creates a feeling of nostalgia. It is a time warp of sorts   to the safety of the1950s when family values were still a part of American society. It jumps back to simpler days when children did as they were told and a day on the beach with family was an acceptable way to spend the weekendâ€”the good old days when all was well with the world.    The busy parents of today can be assured that McDonalds is just as wholesome and just as capable of creating memories as their mothers picnics were in the 1950s. The first line of print below the picture reads   Some connections never seem to fade. The statement refers to the family connection that existed for the parents of today when they were young. The message makes it very clear that the dwindling respect for quality family values is kept alive with McDonalds.    In stark contrast to the quiet shades of gray and the general feeling of calm in the photo   the McDonalds logo stands out sharply in the lower corner. Being the only colored object in the ad   the ketchup and mustard M is impossible to miss. There can be no confusion over whose product is being sold.    The few sentences about   and the image of   Pooh corner appeals to the whole familyâ€”the parents and their Pooh-loving kids. Above the logo and the scene of contentment   the page is blank except for one sentence: Suddenly the house on Pooh corner doesnt seem so far away. This statement   coupled with the image of the girl recreating Poohs world on the beach   emphasizes the idea that McDonalds makes dreams come alive. The ad states that Pooh corner doesnt seem so far away   and right below it is their proofâ€”a little girl playing in Pooh corner    In the lower right corner   below the hideously-bold   trademark M   the ad makes yet another pitch. In this modern world of work and stress   McDonalds kindly asks everyone to smile. In that one   simple word   so much more is implied. Slow down   take a break   were here to help   be happy   come to McDonalds   we understand.    The entire ad is an attempt to appeal to the parental ideal. Connecting McDonalds food with an image of family fun provides an equal alternative for busy parents who dont have room in their lives for quality time with their families. McDonalds is the worlds largest and fastest growing food chain. It brings in billions of dollars a year   has thousands of stockholders and represents one of the biggest food monopolies in the world   but none of that matters in the ad. Life can be good   and it can be bought at McDonalds.  ,look at this ad who would guess that those golden arch bring home approximately fourteen billion dollar a year customer worldwide who would guess that mcdonalds be the world lead food organization and employ over worker in different country the ad be in fact an image of a completely different nature it be a calm nostalgic look ad nothing in the peaceful summer scene hint that mcdonalds have or ever will represent anything other than quality family live the character in the ad be strategically position to inspire within the viewer feeling of fun and familiarity the picture locate at the center of the page depict an old woman with a little girl perhaps her granddaughter beside her the two be lie on their stomach prop up by elbow in the sand neither look up a the camera click catch them at play the little girl giggle a her tiger toy leap over the wall of her castle make of sand her grandmother look on with a know smile perhaps remember the day when she use to play such innocent game the sun shin down on their back and speckle the old woman face through her woven sunhat behind their leg be cross at the ankle in carefree swing the girl in imitation of her clearly admirable grandmother they have obviously be to this beach before and be have the time of their life a with the character the placement of the prop in the ad be very significant the slightly unfocused image of the beach gear on their right be clearly place a a backdrop almost a a side note not directly relate to the mcdonalds message about family value but still essential the responsible grandmother plan ahead and bring along all they might need for a day on the beach but do not need to broadcast it to the viewer in the far corner an umbrella stand shade their picnic blanket beside the grandmother arm be a pair of sunglass and upon her head rest a hat to protect her from the sun oh and whats that in the corner ah yes the mcdonalds happy meal they pick up on their way cheeseburger with french fry be far from the healthy picnic grandma could have bring for her granddaughter but what do that matter theyre spending time together the summer scene in black and white instantly create a feeling of nostalgia it be a time warp of sort to the safety of the s when family value be still a part of american society it jump back to simpler day when child do a they be tell and a day on the beach with family be an acceptable way to spend the weekend the good old day when all be well with the world the busy parent of today can be assure that mcdonalds be just a wholesome and just a capable of create memory a their mother picnic be in the s the first line of print below the picture read some connection never seem to fade the statement refers to the family connection that exist for the parent of today when they be young the message make it very clear that the dwindling respect for quality family value be kept alive with mcdonalds in stark contrast to the quiet shade of gray and the general feeling of calm in the photo the mcdonalds logo stand out sharply in the low corner be the only colored object in the ad the ketchup and mustard m be impossible to miss there can be no confusion over whose product be be sell the few sentence about and the image of pooh corner appeal to the whole family the parent and their pooh love kid above the logo and the scene of contentment the page be blank except for one sentence suddenly the house on pooh corner doesnt seem so far away this statement couple with the image of the girl recreate poohs world on the beach emphasize the idea that mcdonalds make dream come alive the ad state that pooh corner doesnt seem so far away and right below it be their proof a little girl playing in pooh corner in the low right corner below the hideously bold trademark m the ad make yet another pitch in this modern world of work and stress mcdonalds kindly ask everyone to smile in that one simple word so much more be imply slow down take a break be here to help be happy come to mcdonalds we understand the entire ad be an attempt to appeal to the parental ideal connect mcdonalds food with an image of family fun provide an equal alternative for busy parent who dont have room in their life for quality time with their family mcdonalds be the world large and fast grow food chain it bring in billion of dollar a year have thousand of stockholder and represent one of the big food monopoly in the world but none of that matter in the ad life can be good and it can be buy at mcdonalds,+ looking at this ad who would guess that those golden arches bring home approximately fourteen billion dollars a year customers worldwide ?

Another reason is some kids will only drink chocolate Milk Another reason is. they Both have the same amount of protein (8 grams) and calcium. protein Gives you energy calcium makes your bones stronger. chocolate Milk is still really healthy even though it has chocolate in it.,dear mr davis you should serve chocolate milk because it have fat just like fat white milk another reason be some kid will only drink chocolate milk another reason be they both have the same amount of protein gram and calcium protein give you energy calcium make your bone strong chocolate milk be still really healthy even though it have chocolate in it,+ dear + mr . + davis you should serve chocolate milk because . + it has 0 % fat just like 0 % fat white milk . + another reason is some kids will only drink chocolate + milk + another reason is . they + both have the same amount of protein ( 8 grams ) and calcium . protein + gives you energy calcium makes your bones stronger . chocolate + milk is still really healthy even though it has chocolate in it . 
3,In the hot desert of Australia there are many animals big and small. Some of those animals are the kangaroo   the dingo   and the blue-tongued skink. All of animals in the Australian desert must be well adapted to their hot and dangerous environment. The emu and the thorny devil are well adapted to the Australian desert. The emu in Australian has predators like many other animals. The emus have long legs and can run 50 to 60 mph to get away from predators like the dingo. This is a good adaptation so they dont get eaten. The emu babies dont have long legs so they cant go fast to get away from predators. Instead of going fast they have camouflage and hid in the grass and blend in Camouflage is a very good adaptation. The thorny devil is also very well adapted to the extremely dry desert. Even if there is almost no water the thorny devil wont die. It wont die because its horns direct even the smallest bit of rain or morning dew. into its mouth. This is a useful adaptation. Even when there is almost no water it wont die of thirst. The thorny devil also has adaptations to avoid predators. It looks like the sand so its predators cant see it. Camouflage is a good adaptation. The Emu and the thorny devil must be well adapted to the harsh environment of the Australian desert. I think the emu and the thorny devil are some of the most interesting animals on earth.,in the hot desert of australia there be many animal big and small some of those animal be the kangaroo the dingo and the blue tongue skink all of animal in the australian desert must be well adapt to their hot and dangerous environment the emu and the thorny devil be well adapt to the australian desert the emu in australian have predator like many other animal the emu have long leg and can run to mph to get away from predator like the dingo this be a good adaptation so they dont get eat the emu baby dont have long leg so they cant go fast to get away from predator instead of go fast they have camouflage and hid in the grass and blend in camouflage be a very good adaptation the thorny devil be also very well adapt to the extremely dry desert even if there be almost no water the thorny devil wont die it wont die because it horn direct even the small bit of rain or morning dew into it mouth this be a useful adaptation even when there be almost no water it wont die of thirst the thorny devil also have adaptation to avoid predator it look like the sand so it predator cant see it camouflage be a good adaptation the emu and the thorny devil must be well adapt to the harsh environment of the australian desert i think the emu and the thorny devil be some of the most interesting animal on earth,+ in the hot desert of + australia there are many animals big and small . + some of those animals are the kangaroo the dingo and the blue - tongued skink . + all of animals in the + australian desert must be well adapted to their hot and dangerous environment . + the emu and the thorny devil are well adapted to the + australian desert . + the emu in + australian has predators like many other animals . + the emus have long legs and can run 50 to 60 mph to get away from predators like the dingo . + this is a good adaptation so they dont get eaten . + the emu babies dont have long legs so they cant go fast to get away from predators . + instead of going fast they have camouflage and hid in the grass and blend in + camouflage is a very good adaptation . + the thorny devil is also very well adapted to the extremely dry desert . + even if there is almost no water the thorny devil wont die . + it wont die because its horns direct even the smallest bit of rain or morning dew . into its mouth . + this is a useful adaptation . + even when there is almost no water it wont die of thirst . + the thorny devil also has adaptations to avoid predators . + it looks like the sand so its predators cant see it . + camouflage is a good adaptation . + the + emu and the thorny devil must be well adapted to the harsh environment of the + australian desert .

4,Ecotourism can have bad and good effects. In keeping the balance ecotourism is described as something more complicated then it actually is. Ecotourism is really when tourists go to a country to see its wildlife. Ecotourism can help people understand wildlife but it can also harm it. This is a serious problem but there are some solutions. Ecotourism can really ruin things. If ecotourists disturb wildlife they might wreck the ecosystem. Ecotourism can destroy plants and natural habitats. For example ecotourists might trample plants and/or scare animals and/or leave garbage everywhere. Ecotourist need lodging (Hotels and resorts) and bathrooms. These harm the environment by polluting water and destroying forests which the ecotourists would otherwise be looking at. Generally ecotourism is supposed to focus on personal growth and environmental responsibility   but mostly it doesnt.But there is some hope. If everybody puts their heads together we can think up some ways to improve ecotourism   environmentally. All we really need is a few ideas to spark the brain storm   so here they are.One thing we could do is just prevent ecotourism altogether. But then people might forget how to value and treat nature respectfully.  Another thing we could do is set some lower limits than there are at the moment for ecotourism.Something else we could do is decrease the number of ecotourists to a small average. Another good solution is to make pathways and trams and things to keep ecotourists at a distance from wildlife. One more thing we can do to improve ecotourism is to have a class on how to treat the flora and fauna. Those are just 4 things we could to do improve ecotourism.I think those are all the sparks we need. I hope these sparks light up peoples understanding of ecotourism.,ecotourism can have bad and good effect in keep the balance ecotourism be describe a something more complicated then it actually be ecotourism be really when tourist go to a country to see it wildlife ecotourism can help people understand wildlife but it can also harm it this be a serious problem but there be some solution ecotourism can really ruin thing if ecotourists disturb wildlife they might wreck the ecosystem ecotourism can destroy plant and natural habitat for example ecotourists might trample plant and or scare animal and or leave garbage everywhere ecotourist need lodge hotel and resort and bathroom these harm the environment by pollute water and destroying forest which the ecotourists would otherwise be look at generally ecotourism be suppose to focus on personal growth and environmental responsibility but mostly it doesnt but there be some hope if everybody put their head together we can think up some way to improve ecotourism environmentally all we really need be a few idea to spark the brain storm so here they be one thing we could do be just prevent ecotourism altogether but then people might forget how to value and treat nature respectfully another thing we could do be set some low limit than there be at the moment for ecotourism something else we could do be decrease the number of ecotourists to a small average another good solution be to make pathway and tram and thing to keep ecotourists at a distance from wildlife one more thing we can do to improve ecotourism be to have a class on how to treat the flora and fauna those be just thing we could to do improve ecotourism i think those be all the spark we need i hope these spark light up people understand of ecotourism,+ ecotourism can have bad and good effects . + in keeping the balance ecotourism is described as something more complicated then it actually is . + ecotourism is really when tourists go to a country to see its wildlife . + ecotourism can help people understand wildlife but it can also harm it . + this is a serious problem but there are some solutions . + ecotourism can really ruin things . + if ecotourists disturb wildlife they might wreck the ecosystem . + ecotourism can destroy plants and natural habitats . + for example ecotourists might trample plants and / or scare animals and / or leave garbage everywhere . + ecotourist need lodging ( + hotels and resorts ) and bathrooms . + these harm the environment by polluting water and destroying forests which the ecotourists would otherwise be looking at . + generally ecotourism is supposed to focus on personal growth and environmental responsibility but mostly it *url there is some hope . + if everybody puts their heads together we can think up some ways to improve ecotourism environmentally . + all we really need is a few ideas to spark the brain storm so here they *url thing we could do is just prevent ecotourism altogether . + but then people might forget how to value and treat nature respectfully . + another thing we could do is set some lower limits than there are at the moment for *url else we could do is decrease the number of ecotourists to a small average . + another good solution is to make pathways and trams and things to keep ecotourists at a distance from wildlife . + one more thing we can do to improve ecotourism is to have a class on how to treat the flora and fauna . + those are just 4 things we could to do improve ecotourism .

4,I read a book called The Gardener. It is about a girl named Lydia who goes into the city from the country to help her uncle and help him get money. It takes place during the great depression. In spite of the challenges   Lydia succeeded in being happy in the city. It must have been tough for Lydia to leave the country and go to the city at first. She looked really sad to leave in the pictures and looked like she missed her family and her country life. It must have also been hard for her because the city and country are very different. She might think that she was unwelcome there or that people wouldnt like her there. Also she wasnt with her parents so she might miss them too. It is tough to miss your family. When she was in the train station it was dark and scary and she looked tiny and scared. It must not have been very fun for her there at first because everything was dark and scary. Another thing that must not have been very welcoming for her is that her uncle (she is staying with her uncle) never smiles. He always looks grumpy and depressed. It is always more nice to visit a cheerful person rather than a grumpy person. Even though there were challenges   Lydia also succeeded in being happy. There were good things that made up for the bad things. At the beginning   when she first starts helping her uncle in his bakery   she makes friends. She met them because they work with her uncle. It is always nice to have friends wherever you go. Also   it is kind of depressing to not have friends sometimes. Another thing that made lydia happy was that she gardens   she planted flowers and made her street more happy. Everybody   (even her uncle   her uncle is always grumpy) got more cheerful after the flowers. That helped L Everybody   (even her uncle   her uncle is always grumpy) got more cheerful after the flowers. That helped Lydia a lot because for one   she likes planting flowers   and two   everybody seemed more happy and that made her have a good feeling. After that   she realizes the there is a rooftop garden but it is all dead. She plants flowers their with her friend and spruces it up. When it is finished   she brings her frowning uncle up her secret place and shows him around. He tells her to wait there and then a while later he comes up with a beautiful cake. He uncle doesnt actually smile but Lydia thinks the cake is worth a thousand smiles. That is important to Lydia because she has been working to make her uncle smile for a long time and   her uncle is finally happy. Now you can see how   in spite of the challenges   Lydia succeeded in living happily away from home. And   even though there are sometimes challenges in life   there are always good things too.,i read a book call the gardener it be about a girl name lydia who go into the city from the country to help

2,Once there was an abandoned warehouse that was enormous. You could hear growling if you came near. Close to the warehouse lived a kid named Clay who had blue eyes and brown hair and was always ready for an adventure. He was 8 years old. Clay and his younger brothers   Bobby and George   wanted to get into the abandoned warehouse that they had passed by one day while walking. They wanted to find out what was making all that noise. All of them were scared and excited.  But the second time they got there   there were guards. This time   they were really scared   so they left. Then they went there again and the guards were still there. They thought they would never get in!  Then Clay had an idea. How about we go home and get a distraction? They decided that George and Bobby would yell at the guards and say   Hey   buddy! Then they would run around the abandoned warehouse and go in the door and meet Clay. When they got back   the distraction was ready. They were successful.  When they got in   they looked until they heard it. They heard a growl. Lets go   said Bobby and George. They said   OK. They got there   and they heard it again   but they could not see anything. And then they saw it. It was a puppy!

3,We should get a barn cat   Mrs. Thurlow told Mr. Thurlow. Bandit   Sonya   and Sams ears popped up. Bandit   Sonya   and Sam were their barn dogs. Yes! A cat to chase! Bandit yelled. Then Mr. Thurlow said   Sure   but what are we going to name her? Sam thought for a moment. Then Sam walked up to Mr. Thurlow and started to bark. Bandit and Sonya heard Sam say   Whatever you do   dont name her Samantha   dont name her Samantha   DONT name her Samantha! Mrs. Thurlow said   How about â€˜Baby? Mr. and Mrs. Thurlow thought for a while. After much thought   Mr. Thurlow announced   A splendid idea! Lets get her tomorrow! Then the two farmers fed the dogs   ate dinner   did the chores   and then went to bed.  The next morning at 6:00  they did the morning chores. They were ready to pick up Baby at 8:15 a.m. When they got to The Pet Shop in Woodstock   they were in and out. Mr. and Mrs. Thurlow gave Baby a collar when they got home. Also Bandit   Sonya   and Sam gave Baby a tour of everything they own. When they got to the barn   Bandit started to chase Baby   and he said   I cant resist!

3,One sunny day   my mom and I took our kittens for a walk around our house. The kittens were very excited because it was their first time. My kittens names are Flounder and Aerial. Aerial is a girl and Flounder is a boy with a circle on his side. They are both the colors yellow and white.        When we took the kittens outside   we had to be very careful so they would not get loose. Then a car drove by. It scared them and they ran.     Their harnesses got loose and they went into the woods. We went inside to put away the harnesses and the leashes. Then we went back outside to look for them in the woods. We looked left and right   but we couldnt find them. We went back home to make signs to put up that said: LOST KITTENS: yellow and white   call 569-9823. We were very sad.  After a few months   still no one could find them. But   when we were looking for them   the kittens were looking for us! They really wanted to find their way home. The kitten asked a cat named Shadow for help. Shadow said    Your family lives next door   but they are not home they are on vacation. Shadow brought them inside to Theresa. When Theresa saw them   she knew who they lived with. Theresa took care of them until we came home. She called us and said   I have a surprise for you!! I thought that she had found our kittens!   When we went over to her house   we followed her up to the bedroom and saw a cage. When she opened the door   we saw our kittens in it. We were so happy that we went right over and unlocked it. The kittens ran out of the cage and over to us. We took them home and thanked Theresa. We were very happy to see them   and they were happy to see us too!,one sunny day my mom and i take our kitten for a walk around our house the kitten be very excited because it be their first time my kitten name be flounder and aerial aerial be a girl and flounder be a boy with a circle on his side they be both the color yellow and white when we take the kitten outside we have to be very careful so they would not get loose then a car drove by it scar them and they run their harness get loose and they go into the wood we go inside to put away the harness and the leash then we go back outside to look for them in the wood we look leave and right but we couldnt find them we go back home to make sign to put up that say lose kitten yellow and white call we be very sad after a few month still no one could find them but when we be look for them the kitten be look for u they really want to find their way home the kitten ask a cat name shadow for help shadow say your family live next door but they be not home they be on vacation shadow bring them inside to theresa when theresa saw them she know who they live with theresa take care of them until we come home she call u and say i have a surprise for you i think that she have find our kitten when we go over to her house we follow her up to the bedroom and saw a cage when she open the door we saw our kitten in it we be so happy that we go right over and unlock it the kitten run out of the cage and over to u we take them home and thanked theresa we be very happy to see them and they be happy to see u too,+ one sunny day my mom and I took our kittens for a walk around our house . + the kittens were very excited because it was their first time . + my kittens names are + flounder and + aerial . + aerial is a girl and + flounder is a boy with a circle on his side . + they are both the colors yellow and white . + when we took the kittens outside we had to be very careful so they would not get loose . + then a car drove by . + it scared them and they ran . + their harnesses got loose and they went into the woods . + we went inside to put away the harnesses and the leashes . + then we went back outside to look for them in the woods . + we looked left and right but we couldnt find them . + we went back home to make signs to put up that said : + lost + kittens : yellow and white call 569 - 9823 . + we were very sad . + after a few months still no one could find them . + but when we were looking for them the kittens were looking for us ! + they really wanted to find their way home . + the kitten asked a cat named + shadow for help . + shadow said + your family lives next door but they are not home they are on vacation . + shadow brought them inside to + theresa . + when + theresa saw them she knew who they lived with . + theresa took care of them until we came home . + she called us and said I have a surprise for you ! !

3,Once upon a time there was a pioneer family that was moving west. The members of the family were moving west because they wanted to find more gold. They had to gather their livestock. They used horses. They packed pots and pans   food and drinks. The family was travelling from Massachusetts to Oregon. They started to go. Anna   the little girl   said   I wish something would happen   and it did. They came upon Indians. The Indians were nice enough to let them go past. A few days later   the family came upon Oregon. Yeah! everyone shouted. Ma said   Lets unpack and dig for gold. Pa said   After we dig for gold   lets build a farm to keep our livestock in and to live in. They lived happily ever after.,once upon a time there be a pioneer family that be move west the member of the family be move west because they want to find more gold they have to gather their livestock they use horse they pack pot and pan food and drink the family be travel from massachusetts to oregon they start to go anna the little girl say i wish something would happen and it do they come upon indian the indian be nice enough to let them go past a few day later the family come upon oregon yeah everyone shout ma say let unpack and dig for gold pa say after we dig for gold let build a farm to keep our livestock in and to live in they live happily ever after,+ once upon a time there was a pioneer family that was moving west . + the members of the family were moving west because they wanted to find more gold . + they had to gather their livestock . + they used horses . + they packed pots and pans food and drinks . + the family was travelling from + massachusetts to + oregon . + they started to go . + anna the little girl said I wish something would happen and it did . + they came upon + indians . + the + indians were nice enough to let them go past .

4,There once was a dog that roamed an alley with another dog. That dogs name was Max. The other dogs name was Rocky. Max and Rocky were brother and sister   although they looked nothing alike. In another alley   not far from Max and Rockys   there was a dog and a cat that lived together. The dogs name was Sugar   and the cats name was Shantell. One day   they all met behind a trash can and became best buds.     One day while all the friends were out walking in the street   Shantell spotted a ghost flying around in a house and took off running to go see the ghost. Then all the dogs took off after her. When the dogs finally caught up to Shantell   they were all deep in the haunted house. Max and Sugar started to shake. Rocky and Shantell started to quake. Then a loud boom came from the floor above them. After   Max got a brilliant idea: they should sneak up on the monsters and attack them.    Finally   all four animals were ready to put their maniacal plan into action. Shantell tiptoed up the mantel while Max and Sugar went up the back stairs   which left Rocky to creep up the front stairs. When they all were ready to attack the monsters   they heard music. The music sounded a lot like this: Shake   shake   shake dem bones now! The friends were confused but quickly got back on track. Shantell gave the ready signal   and they all jumped up.    They were surprised to see what they saw. They saw about a dozen monsters doing the Monster Mash. One of the vampires said   Come in   dogs and cats. Why dont you dance with us? So Max   Rocky   Sugar   and Shantell danced with the monsters.       ,there once be a dog that roam an alley with another dog that dog name be max the other dog name be rocky max and rocky be brother and sister although they look nothing alike in another alley not far from max and rockys there be a dog and a cat that live together the dog name be sugar and the cat name be shantell one day they all meet behind a trash can and become best bud one day while all the friend be out walk in the street shantell spot a ghost fly around in a house and take off run to go see the ghost then all the dog take off after her when the dog finally catch up to shantell they be all deep in the haunt house max and sugar start to shake rocky and shantell start to quake then a loud boom come from the floor above them after max get a brilliant idea they should sneak up on the monster and attack them finally all four animal be ready to put their maniacal plan into action shantell tiptoe up the mantel while max and sugar go up the back stair which leave rocky to creep up the front stair when they all be ready to attack the monster they hear music the music sound a lot like this shake shake shake dem bone now the friend be confuse but quickly get back on track shantell give the ready signal and they all jump up they be surprise to see what they saw they saw about a dozen monster do the monster mash one of the vampire say come in dog and cat why dont you dance with u so max rocky sugar and shantell dance with the monster,+ there once was a dog that roamed an alley with another dog . + that dogs name was + max . + the other dogs name was + rocky . + max and + rocky were brother and sister although they looked nothing alike . + in another alley not far from + max and + rockys there was a dog and a cat that lived together . + the dogs name was + sugar and the cats name was + shantell . + one day they all met behind a trash can and became best buds . + one day while all the friends were out walking in the street + shantell spotted a ghost flying around in a house and took off running to go see the ghost . + then all the dogs took off after her . + when the dogs finally caught up to + shantell they were all deep in the haunted house . + max and + sugar started to shake . + rocky and + shantell started to quake . + then a loud boom came from the floor above them . + after + max got a brilliant idea : they should sneak up on the monsters and attack them . + finally all four animals were ready to put their maniacal plan into action . + shantell tiptoed up the mantel while + max and + sugar went up the back stairs which left + rocky to creep up the front stairs . + when they all were ready to attack the monsters they heard music . + the music sounded a lot like this : + shake shake shake dem bones now ! + the friends were confused but quickly got back on track . + shantell gave the ready signal and they all jumped up . + they were surprised to see what they saw . + they saw about a dozen monsters doing the + monster + mash . + one of the vampires said + come in dogs and cats . + why dont you dance with us ? + so + max + rocky + sugar and + shantell danced with the monsters . 
4,It was Sunday. My family and I were in France. I was as happy as a bee. We were driving along the road when my daddy stopped the car. He told my brother and sister to get out of the car to see what the furry lump on the side of the road was. They got out of the car. Ten seconds later   they got back in the car with a very small kitten in their hands. She was about the size of a very   very   very   very small baby bottle. My stomach went into my throat when I saw it actually was a kitten. She was meowing as loud as a foghorn. It was so horrible   I couldnt think. Mreow. I felt horrible. I knew that I hadnt done anything bad to her   but I just couldnt help it. She was so cold. I was worried. Her claws were as sharp as sewing needles being pricked into your skin. I shuddered. She had crusts over her eyes   from infections   that looked like they hurt.     We were headed into the village. Madame Sanz was there. We asked her what to do. I was afraid that she wouldnt have any advice. Thankfully   she told us what to do. She told us to boil rose petals in water till they were warm and wet. Then we should pour them into a bowl with some water and keep on rubbing then over the kittens eyes.     After that   we decided to call the little kitten Rosalita. We also call her other things that sound like Rosalita   but I wont mention that. We prayed. Luckily   she is still with us now. Hopefully   she will be with us much   much   much   much longer.  ,it be sunday my family and i be in france i be as happy a a bee we be drive along the road when my daddy stop the car he tell my brother and sister to get out of the car to see what the furry lump on the side of the road be they get out of the car ten second later they get back in the car with a very small kitten in their hand she be about the size of a very very very very small baby bottle my stomach go into my throat when i saw it actually be a kitten she be meow as loud a a foghorn it be so horrible i couldnt think mreow i felt horrible i know that i hadnt do anything bad to her but i just couldnt help it she be so cold i be worried her claw be as sharp a sew needle be prick into your skin i shudder she have crust over her eye from infection that look like they hurt we be head into the village madame sanz be there we ask her what to do i be afraid that she wouldnt have any advice thankfully she tell u what to do she tell u to boil rise petal in water till they be warm and wet then we should pour them into a bowl with some water and keep on rub then over the kitten eye after that we decide to call the little kitten rosalita we also call her other thing that sound like rosalita but i wont mention that we pray luckily she be still with u now hopefully she will be with u much much much much longer,+ it was + sunday . + my family and I were in + france .

5,Its too bad that Mr. Griff is closing the shop   Queen thought to herself. Queen and the three dogs had been pets of Mr. Griff   the owner   but now the shop was going out of business   and Mr. Griff put all the furniture outside his shop so people could look at it.  Queen had to hold a meeting with the dogs. They loved the shop   but they would probably have to go to the pound because Mr. Griff wouldnt be able to feed them with what little money he had. Queen meowed a couple of times   and the dogs came bounding over. First Charlie   then Skip   and then Spot. Queen climbed up to the top of the velvet chair and got right down to the point. You guys are going to have to leave here or go to the pound. What do you want to do?   We wouldnt go to the pound for anything   they chorused.  So I guess youre leaving   Queen said. Queen was trying to hold tears back. She loved the dogs   but she wouldnt be able to come with them. She had a bad leg   and whenever she tried to run   pain would shoot up her leg like a lightning bolt electrocuting someone. Queen would have to go to the pound or be a street catâ€”an idea she disliked.   Do you boys have all your toys with you?   Yes   we do.   Are you sure you will be OK without me?  We think so.  Queen followed the boys into the shop so she could hear their barks of goodbye to Mr. Griff. But Mr. Griff was talking to a man. After what seemed like an eternity   the man left with a grin on his face. Mr. Griff also had a grin on his face. My wonderful pets   we will be able to stay in the upstairs apartment because that wonderful man bought the shop from us   but he is letting us stay upstairs still! The dogs jumped for joy   and even though she couldnt jump   Queen started to purr.  ,it too bad that mr griff be close the shop queen think to herself queen and the three dog have be pet of mr griff the owner but now the shop be go out of business and mr griff put all the furniture outside his shop so people could look at it queen have to hold a meeting with the dog they love the shop but they would probably have to go to the pound because mr griff wouldnt be able to fee them with what little money he have queen meow a couple of time and the dog come bound over first charlie then skip and then spot queen climb up to the top of the velvet chair and get right down to the point you guy be go to have to leave here or go to the pound what do you want to do we wouldnt go to the pound for anything they chorus so i guess youre leave queen say queen be try to hold tear back she love the dog but she wouldnt be able to come with them she have a bad leg and whenever she try to run pain would shoot up her leg like a lightning bolt electrocute someone queen would have to go to the pound or be a street cat an idea she dislike do you boys have all your toy with you yes we do be you sure you will be ok without me we think so queen follow the boy into the shop so she could hear their bark of goodbye to mr griff but mr griff be talk to a man after what seem like an eternity the man leave with a grin on his face mr griff also have a grin on his face my wonderful pet we will be able to stay in the upstairs apartment because that wonderful man buy the shop from u but he be let u stay upstairs still the dog jump for joy and even though she couldnt jump queen start to purr,+ its too bad that + mr . + griff is closing the shop + queen thought to herself . + queen and the three dogs had been pets of + mr . + griff the owner but now the shop was going out of business and + mr . + griff put all the furniture outside his shop so people could look at it . + queen had to hold a meeting with the dogs . + they loved the shop but they would probably have to go to the pound because + mr . + griff wouldnt be able to feed them with what little money he had . + queen meowed a couple of times and the dogs came bounding over . + first + charlie then + skip and then + spot . + queen climbed up to the top of the velvet chair and got right down to the point . + you guys are going to have to leave here or go to the pound . + what do you want to do ? + we wouldnt go to the pound for anything they chorused . + so I guess youre leaving + queen said . + queen was trying to hold tears back . + she loved the dogs but she wouldnt be able to come with them . + she had a bad leg and whenever she tried to run pain would shoot up her leg like a lightning bolt electrocuting someone . + queen would have to go to the pound or be a street catan idea she disliked . + do you boys have all your toys with you ? + yes we do . + are you sure you will be + ok without me ? + we think so . + queen followed the boys into the shop so she could hear their barks of goodbye to + mr . + griff . + but + mr . + griff was talking to a man . + after what seemed like an eternity the man left with a grin on his face . + mr . + griff also had a grin on his face . + my wonderful pets we will be able to stay in the upstairs apartment because that wonderful man bought the shop from us but he is letting us stay upstairs still ! + the dogs jumped for joy and even though she couldnt jump + queen started to purr . 
5,I dip my fountain pen into the ink container. I place the pen on the paper. What will be the first words of the Declaration of Independence? They must be convincing and also get the message to King George that we want to be free. After waiting for what seems like an hour   I print the words The Colonists of the new land want to . . . No! That wont do. The words must be more convincing. I crumble the paper and throw it across the room. I dip the pen again and place the pen on a new   clean sheet of paper. Now I print the words We hold these truths to be self-evident   that all men are created equal . . . No! That will go later in the paper   I scream   now ripping up the paper. Im so angry that when I dip my pen   ink splatters on my white cuff. After an hour   I decide on the first words: When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bonds . . . Yes!

5,Charlie    if you dont like your oatmeal just tell me and Ill get you some cereal   Mom said   looking over the table with a puzzled face.    Her daughter   Charlie   short for Charlene   was chewing her favorite food slowly and carefully   and she was making a funny face. Charlies twin sister   Tess   was doing the same thing. We like oatmeal   but we dont want to disturb them   said Tess.    Disturb who? asked Aaron   their older brother. He shook his curly black hair and looked strangely at Mom. She looked back and shrugged.    Tess and Charlie threw back their tiny   red copper heads and showed their teeth. They each wiggled one and smiled. Looth tooth   said Aaron getting up from the table and putting on his backpack.    Looth tooth   said Tess and Charlie at the same time. They were walking out the door with Aaron to catch the bus. Mom followed them out the door and got into the car to go to work.    Bye    kids   see you after school! called Mom   backing out of the driveway.    On the bus   Charlie and Tess decided to tell their best best friend Molly first about their teeth. When they got to school   they ran into kindergarten room faster than Aaron could run to the eighth grade room. In the classroom   they met the very person they wanted to see   Molly Stagburn.    Molly! Molly   guess what? yelled the twins.    What? said Molly.    We have loose teeth! said the twins with a big smile. A look of horror spread across Mollys face.    Oh   no! she said.    My big brother Zack said that when one tooth comes out the rest come out too. He knows everything because  hes almost in third grade. Tess and Charlie almost cried.    At snack   they only ate one cracker each   and at lunch they decided not to eat at all. After lunch   their teacher   Mrs. Tellen   noticed they where looking sort of pale.    Charlie   Tess   are you feeling alright?    No   they replied.    Oh dear   I suppose I should call your mother   she sighed and walked over to the phone.    Half an hour later   the twins found themselves in the back of their mothers car.  Girls   I would like you to tell me what made you sick. Was it something you ate? Charlie and Tess looked at each other.    Actually Mom   we havent eaten all day   said Tess.    But you told me what you wanted. Did you change your minds?    No. but we didnt want all our teeth to fall out.    What did Aaron tell you this time? Mom asked remembering the time Aaron had told them that if you ate bananas   monkeys would fly out your ears. It wasnt Aaron this time. Mollys brother said that if one tooth comes out   the others come out too   said Tess as they pulled into the driveway.    Mollys brother has a grapenut for a brain. Mom joked.    When they were inside the house   Mom put them on stools and gave them each apples. Almost immediately   they forgot about their teeth and ate.    Now you listen to me. All your teeth are not going to fall out. The only way that would happen would be if Aaron punched you hard enough.

6,I was sitting at a park bench when I saw the endless black heading towards me. Mom look! I screamed. My mom turned around and faced me. A look of pure horror was painted across her face.  Margaret come on we need to go now!  She shouted. We ran across roads and dried up cropt fields. We did not dare look back. Suddenly I wasnt running away from the black cloud. Instead I was face down in the dirt. Oh no I had tripped over my shoelace! I slowly looked up where was my mom? The cloud loomed closer and closer. I choked feeling the gritty dust in my throat. I tryed to crawl forward but needles shot through my legs. Oh great in a time like this my legs fall asleep! A whiff of dust blew toward me   burning my eyes and making everything blury.  Mom! I screamed. Mom!  I tryed to yell again but was choked by more dust. Mom I whined. Where was she. I started coughing from all of the dust in my lungs and throat.   Margaret! Darling come on! My mom motioned me to get up but I shook my head.  My Mom flung me into her arms and ran   soaring farther away from the storm. After what seemed forever   my mom stopped running. Screams and yells echoed off walls. I covered my ears.    A person right in front of us said:     Get inside quickly!  My mom answered okay and then I was carried into a building   that looked like the town hall.   My mom set me down n a corner   in the town hall and sat next to me. Mom? I croaked.  Yes Sweetie? She said in a sweet voice   almost like honey.   Is this going to happen ever again   this storm? I asked my voice still thick with dust. She did not answer and I knew that she knew this wouldnt be the the last time the black mountains of dust attacked the plain states.  ,i be sit at a park bench when i saw the endless black heading towards me mom look i scream my mom turn around and face me a look of pure horror be paint across her face margaret come on we need to go now she shout we run across road and dry up cropt field we do not dare look back suddenly i wasnt run away from the black cloud instead i be face down in the dirt oh no i have trip over my shoelace i slowly look up where be my mom the cloud loom close and closer i choke feel the gritty dust in my throat i try to crawl forward but needle shoot through my legs oh great in a time like this my legs fall asleep a whiff of dust blew toward me burn my eye and make everything blury mom i scream mom i try to yell again but be choke by more dust mom i whine where be she i start cough from all of the dust in my lung and throat margaret darling come on my mom motion me to get up but i shake my head my mom fling me into her arm and run soar far away from the storm after what seem forever my mom stop run scream and yell echo off wall i cover my ear a person right in front of u say get inside quickly my mom answer okay and then i be carry into a building that look like the town hall my mom set me down n a corner in the town hall and sit next to me mom i croak yes sweetie she say in a sweet voice almost like honey be this go to happen ever again this storm i ask my voice still thick with dust she do not answer and i know that she know this wouldnt be the the last time the black mountain of dust attack the plain state,I was sitting at a park bench when I saw the endless black heading towards me . + mom look !

6,A long   long time ago   there were many gods. Two were Sarias the salt god   and Walior the water god. They argued quite a bit and all of the other gods were sick of it. So was a newt named Yellow-Belly. I was the middle of the summer and one day when the gods were on a ship   Yellow-Belly had also snuck aboard. Once again   they were arguing and Yellow-Belly decided to put a stop to it once and for all.    Sarias how can you put up with that insolent Walior? You guys should have a battle and whoever loses will be dead and you wont have to worry about arguing anymore.    Meanwhile up in the sky the other gods are trying to figure out a way to get the two gods to stop arguing but they didnt want it to be in a violent way. They have no idea what the shrewd newt Yellow-Belly was up to.    Yellow-Belly gets Walior alone and now he want Walior to have a battle too. Walior why are you just sitting here you guys should have a battle to the death so that you wont have to argue about whos right anymore.    Well Yellow-Belly I dont know what if I lose and get killed?    Walior are you really asking me that? Of course you wont lose and get killed. I mean you are the better of the two. You are more handsome and way stronger. You have nothing to lose by having a battle because Sarias is sure to lose.    Of course you are right Yellow-Belly and that is a great idea.  Now Yellow-Belly has Walior eager to do battle with Sarias   but what if Sarias doesnt agree?    So Sarias have you made up your mind on whether you will have a battle with Walior?    No not really because I am worried that Walior might win.    Oh you mean that great buffoon. He couldnt beat you if your eyes were shut and your hands tied up my lord. You have no need to worry about him because YOU are sure to be the winner. You are smaller sure but you have cunning and fearlessness on your side. I mean   have you lost a battle yet? No   because you are the best god ever.    I guess you are right and I will do as you suggest. But what about Walior?    Oh dont worry about him my lord I have already taken care of him. He will die at your hand.    All right you gods are you ready for your battle? You know who will win and you dont need to worry about it.    So Sarias   you sure you want to do this? You know that I will win because I am much more handsome and I am way stronger.    Even so Walior I am more cunning and I havent lost to any beast yet.    Theres always a first time Sarias.    There was a great battle that lasted 8 days and 8 nights. Eventually Sarias emerged victorious. As he was standing over Walior and gloating: Ha ha I have killed you Wâ€¦    As he said this Walior reached up and slashed him in the stomach. As Sarias fell from the pain   his great-sword plunged into Waliors heart. And so the great Sarias won the battle but he died in the end from his stomach wound because Walior had been very vicious and had cut a major artery. And so they both died because of a newt who was fed up with their antics. After they died   they both had left behind great quantities of both salt and water. The other gods saw it and they had to figure out what to do with all of that salt and water.    They were smart and they did the smartest thing that they could think of. They mixed all of the salt with all the water   and they made salt water. Then they picked a HUGE place to distribute all of it and there is now salt water because of that crazy newt   Yellow-Belly.    But of course   Yellow-Belly had to be punished. However   the other gods were so happy because they didnt have to deal with arguing between the deceased   that they didnt want to punish Yellow-Belly very much. They just sentenced him and all of his descendants to a life in pond water with NO talking.  ,a long long time ago there be many god two be sarias the salt god and walior the water god they argue quite a bit and all of the other god be sick of it so be a newt name yellow belly i be the middle of the summer and one day when the god be on a ship yellow belly have also sneak aboard once again they be argue and yellow belly decide to put a stop to it once and for all sarias how can you put up with that insolent walior you guy should have a battle and whoever loses will be dead and you wont have to worry about argue anymore meanwhile up in the sky the other god be try to figure out a way to get the two god to stop argue but they didnt want it to be in a violent way they have no idea what the shrewd newt yellow belly be up to yellow belly get walior alone and now he want walior to have a battle too walior why be you just sit here you guy should have a battle to the death so that you wont have to argue about who right anymore well yellow belly i dont know what if i lose and get kill walior be you really ask me that of course you wont lose and get kill i mean you be the good of the two you be more handsome and way strong you have nothing to lose by have a battle because sarias be sure to lose of course you be right yellow belly and that be a great idea now yellow belly have walior eager to do battle with sarias but what if sarias doesnt agree so sarias have you make up your mind on whether you will have a battle with walior no not really because i be worried that walior might win oh you mean that great buffoon he couldnt beat you if your eye be shut and your hand tie up my lord you have no need to worry about him because you be sure to be the winner you be small sure but you have cunning and fearlessness on your side i mean have you lose a battle yet no because you be the best god ever i guess you be right and i will do a you suggest but what about walior oh dont worry about him my lord i have already take care of him he will die at your hand all right you god be you ready for your battle you know who will win and you dont need to worry about it so sarias you sure you want to do this you know that i will win because i be much more handsome and i be way strong even so walior i be more cunning and i havent lose to any beast yet theres always a first time sarias there be a great battle that last day and night eventually sarias emerged victorious a he be stand over walior and gloat ha ha i have kill you w a he say this walior reach up and slash him in the stomach a sarias fell from the pain his great sword plunge into waliors heart and so the great sarias win the battle but he die in the end from his stomach wound because walior have be very vicious and have cut a major artery and so they both die because of a newt who be feed up with their antic after they die they both have leave behind great quantity of both salt and water the other god saw it and they have to figure out what to do with all of that salt and water they be smart and they do the smart thing that they could think of they mix all of the salt with all the water and they make salt water then they pick a huge place to distribute all of it and there be now salt water because of that crazy newt yellow belly but of course yellow belly have to be punish however the other god be so happy because they didnt have to deal with argue between the decease that they didnt want to punish yellow belly very much they just sentence him and all of his descendant to a life in pond water with no talk,A long long time ago there were many gods . + two were + sarias the salt god and + walior the water god . + they argued quite a bit and all of the other gods were sick of it . + so was a newt named + yellow - + belly .

7,My family thought our lives were absolutely perfect. My twelve year old mind thought so   too   until our Sunday paper arrived. I heard the clunk of the mail slot   and sprinted to get the first peek of the paper. People on the first page were being interviewed by frantic news reporters   wanting to know reasons for our year long hot weather. I thought they were crazy   until they were right.    Days went by   and the hot temperatures got worse. Hot baths were long gone   replaced with iced cold water. We had all ate the cold foods we could eat   no more ovens or fires   if you were rich enough. Our family had a fire   and a pan. We stopped doing that yesterday. I slipped out of my thoughts as my younger sister   Leesh   yelled out names. Mom! Dad! Mary! Come see this!    The yell was far distance   followed by a scream so high pitch   I sprinted outside   into the woods to find Leesh. Mom and Dad followed   pale with panic and worry. I smelled my own blood   from all the thorns in our woods. I felt the trickling on my legs   my bare legs   and arms   lucky my sundress hasnt yet ripped. Leesh! Leesh - where are you? I saw our fallen treehouse   and something a little beyond the trees.     Mom   Dad   get Leesh down. I think I see something beyond the trees! They opened their mouths to say something   but they were lost for words   as I ran. Tree branches   sticks   thorn bushes   and stumps were my obstacles. I noticed the animals all ran the opposite way   with fear and shock in their faces and eyes. I got to the end   staring in shock at the terrifying sight in front of me.    Over the hills   rather than sun and clouds   I saw it. A big   pitch black cloud   thousands and thousands of feet tall   making any tree look like action figures. It moved with the wind blowing its way towards me. It came up the last hill   the one I stood on. The dust cloud swallowed me   and it whipped me in the face   stinging me like needles piercing every inch of my helpless body. I still sprinted   as fast as my legs could take me   swallowing the dust in my mouth   nose   and burning eyes. I wheezed   coughed   and barely breathed. I felt myself suffocating   remembering my name   will myself I would make it. You can do this Mary   you can get out of this. I opened my mouth to scream   instead filling myself with gallons of dust in my throat and lungs. I realized I was finally back in the woods   almost reaching my terrified family. I took huge rock   and wrote with saliva and dust. My vision blurred and I tripped over tree branches   rocks   and anything in my way. I tumbled   over my head   crashing on the ground. I felt myself suffocate before my head hit the rock   never seeing light or dust   as my body shut down.,my family think our life be absolutely perfect my twelve year old mind think so too until our sunday paper arrive i hear the clunk of the mail slot and sprint to get the first peek of the paper people on the first page be be interview by frantic news reporter want to know reason for our year long hot weather i think they be crazy until they be right day go by and the hot temperature get bad hot bath be long go replace with iced cold water we have all eat the cold food we could eat no more oven or fire if you be rich enough our family have a fire and a pan we stop do that yesterday i slip out of my thought a my young sister leesh yell out name mom dad mary come see this the yell be far distance follow by a scream so high pitch i sprint outside into the wood to find leesh mom and dad follow pale with panic and worry i smell my own blood from all the thorn in our wood i felt the trickling on my legs my bare leg and arm lucky my sundress hasnt yet rip leesh leesh where be you i saw our fall treehouse and something a little beyond the tree mom dad get leesh down i think i see something beyond the tree they open their mouth to say something but they be lose for word a i run tree branch stick thorn bush and stump be my obstacle i notice the animal all run the opposite way with fear and shock in their face and eye i get to the end staring in shock at the terrify sight in front of me over the hill rather than sun and cloud i saw it a big pitch black cloud thousand and thousand of foot tall make any tree look like action figure it move with the wind blow it way towards me it come up the last hill the one i stand on the dust cloud swallow me and it whip me in the face sting me like needle pierce every inch of my helpless body i still sprint as fast a my leg could take me swallow the dust in my mouth nose and burn eye i wheeze coughed and barely breathe i felt myself suffocate remember my name will myself i would make it you can do this mary you can get out of this i open my mouth to scream instead fill myself with gallon of dust in my throat and lung i realize i be finally back in the wood almost reach my terrified family i take huge rock and write with saliva and dust my vision blur and i trip over tree branch rock and anything in my way i tumble over my head crash on the ground i felt myself suffocate before my head hit the rock never see light or dust a my body shut down,+ my family thought our lives were absolutely perfect . + my twelve year old mind thought so too until our + sunday paper arrived .

7,The young boy stood with the most menacing look he could muster spread across his face. He just stood there watching the endless columns stretch as far as the eye could see down the long   dusty road. The soldiers would turn and look as they went by    and he made sure to look right back. He made sure to stare as far as he could into the dark pupils of their eyes   as if it would raise the house that was now nothing more than a heap of ashes. Only a few charred remains of the walls were left.    As his eyes went from soldiers to remains he saw a small soft lump poking up from the ashes. He knew exactly what it was and he turned away. That teddy bear had been his favorite friend. Not a toy   it was more than a toy to him. For a second he was back on a green lawn   with the shutters of a house tapping softly on the window pane. And there was his bear. They waited for the next pirate ship to come around the bend in the road   so they could board it and make the captain walk the plank. But then he heard a shout and knew he was back on the dusty road with no green lawn and no shutters tapping softly.    He leaped down from his perch on an old dresser   one of the few things that hadnt been pillaged or burned in the fire. He bent down   putting both hands on his knees as his eyes searched the ground intently. He picked up the most deadly rock he could find and hopped back up on his perch to resume his watchful glare. No soldier escaped the watchful eyes as he probed them. The giant snake of blue tails was tapering off   and the boy could now see the end of the tail. The boy once again hopped down from his perch.

8,I walked past the playground. The pigeons swarmed around the crumbs of food dropped by children   and made a cloud filled with feathers   dust   and leaves. Admiring the day with every step   I continued to walk through Central Park. I strode out of the park and onto the sidewalk. As I walked a few blocks   I picked out the tourists from the crowds. Most of them were stopping by every table to buy either and I love NY shirt or a postcard.    Finally   I saw the fountains and the big stone columns that protected the Metropolitan Museum. I ran up the endless steps   dodging the people and cameras. I entered the cavernous halls   donated my dollar   and was directed through stairways   exhibits   and halls. After I walked through the Greek pottery section   I entered the exhibit of Richard Avedon. It was my first time seeing his photographs   and I was fascinated.    I saw portraits of Marian Anderson   former presidents   and Andy Warhol. The crowds moved slowly   as if to try to suck up the emotions of the photographs for life. Several  people blocked doorways   selfishly. With a little but meaningful push   I moved on. Each room was watched by a security guard   I thought of how lucky they were to be able to see these photos every day and have the time to think about each person being photographed. Most of the people were very important to society and history. Some photos were being blocked off   from the amount of people crowding around them   while other photos were lonely. I felt badly for those photos and made sure I stopped to look at them. Each photograph was in black and white but was able to capture the persons emotions and personality.     About three quarters of the way through the exhibit   I came across a lonely photo. I immediately walked over to it   and then when I was two feet away   I realized that the man in the photo must have been upset and lost. The mans face was round but hollow. His eyes were sunken in a he had dark bags surrounding them. He was beginning to go bald and his hair was warn and messy. He looked as if he hadnt bothered to shave for a week and little black prickles were starting to grow in where his beard should be. He appeared crushed and broken. Small tears gathered at the bottom of each eye   the type of tears that hadnt fallen yet but made the world around you look blurry. His mind seemed chained to a memory that he couldnt escape. I felt awful   sorry   and shocked.    Blinking my eyes   I woke myself from my daze. I looked at the bottom left hand corner of the portrait. His name was Colonel Paul Tibbets. I had never heard his name before. Then I noticed the words under his name. He was titled as the pilot of the B-29 Enola Gay. He was titled as the man who dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima on August 6  1945. As my lips repeated these words to myself   I felt even more sorry and even more shocked. I sensed from the photograph that when he dropped the bomb   he didnt know what he was doing. The photo told me he regretted it   and I sensed that he felt guilty and responsible for the 200 000 lives lost that day.    He was a man who made a huge impact on World War II. He is a man who models for us what war really is. He opened our eyes by dropping a monster who could not be tamed. Things like this happen during wars. People are killed. Not just the phony actors who spill their fake blood and fire their fake guns with fake smoke. Real people are killed. Nearly every person sees movies on wars. People are taught through commercialism that those movies are what was really is.    Before seeing this photograph   I was like other people who thought war was a bunch of GI Joes   dressed in camouflage   being brave. But after seeing this photo   I realized that war was just pain and misery. It made me wake up to the real world and learn that everyone is affected by war   both those who are killed and injured and those who kill and injure them. Both sides of people are innocent. By looking into Colonel Paul Tibbets watered eyes   I was awakened to what happened and what can happen in war. He helped define the word victim. In war   those who are bombed   hurt and killed are victims   but those who are instructed to perform terrible acts in war are victims too. War affects everyone. Everyone is innocent. Everyone is a victim.    I wish that people could see this photograph before making opinions on war today. I wish that Colonel Paul Tibbets lonely picture was surrounded by crowds at the Met. I wish that he had the opportunity to teach more people from his huge mistake rather than us learning by another being made. ,i walk past the playground the pigeon swarm around the crumb of food drop by child and make a cloud fill with feather dust and leave admire the day with every step i continue to walk through central park i stride out of the park and onto the sidewalk a i walk a few block i pick out the tourist from the crowd most of them be stop by every table to buy either and i love ny shirt or a postcard finally i saw the fountain and the big stone column that protect the metropolitan museum i run up the endless step dodge the people and camera i enter the cavernous hall donate my dollar and be direct through stairway exhibit and hall after i walk through the greek pottery section i enter the exhibit of richard avedon it be my first time see his photograph and i be fascinate i saw portrait of marian anderson former president and andy warhol the crowd move slowly a if to try to suck up the emotion of the photograph for life several people block doorway selfishly with a little but meaningful push i move on each room be watch by a security guard i thought of how lucky they be to be able to see these photo every day and have the time to think about each person be photograph most of the people be very important to society and history some photo be be block off from the amount of people crowd around them while other photo be lonely i felt badly for those photo and make sure i stop to look at them each photograph be in black and white but be able to capture the person emotion and personality about three quarter of the way through the exhibit i come across a lonely photo i immediately walk over to it and then when i be two foot away i realize that the man in the photo must have be upset and lose the man face be round but hollow his eye be sink in a he have dark bag surround them he be begin to go bald and his hair be warn and messy he look a if he hadnt bother to shave for a week and little black prickle be start to grow in where his beard should be he appear crushed and break small tear gather at the bottom of each eye the type of tear that hadnt fall yet but make the world around you look blurry his mind seem chain to a memory that he couldnt escape i felt awful sorry and shock blink my eye i wake myself from my daze i look at the bottom leave hand corner of the portrait his name be colonel paul tibbets i have never hear his name before then i notice the word under his name he be title a the pilot of the b enola gay he be title a the man who drop the atomic bomb on hiroshima on august a my lip repeat these word to myself i felt even more sorry and even more shocked i sense from the photograph that when he drop the bomb he didnt know what he be do the photo tell me he regret it and i sense that he felt guilty and responsible for the life lose that day he be a man who make a huge impact on world war ii he be a man who model for u what war really be he open our eye by drop a monster who could not be tame thing like this happen during war people be kill not just the phony actor who spill their fake blood and fire their fake gun with fake smoke real people be kill nearly every person see movie on war people be teach through commercialism that those movie be what be really be before see this photograph i be like other people who think war be a bunch of gi joes dress in camouflage be brave but after see this photo i realize that war be just pain and misery it make me wake up to the real world and learn that everyone be affect by war both those who be kill and injure and those who kill and injure them both side of people be innocent by look into colonel paul tibbets water eye i be awaken to what happen and what can happen in war he help define the word victim in war those who be bomb hurt and kill be victim but those who be instruct to perform terrible act in war be victim too war affect everyone everyone be innocent everyone be a victim i wish that people could see this photograph before make opinion on war today i wish that colonel paul tibbets lonely picture be surround by crowd at the met i wish that he have the opportunity to teach more people from his huge mistake rather than u learn by another be make,I walked past the playground . + the pigeons swarmed around the crumbs of food dropped by children and made a cloud filled with feathers dust and leaves . + admiring the day with every step I continued to walk through + central + park .

8,The cool afternoon wind brushed against my face. I watched as the kids played with a rabbit they had found in the woods. All around me the sounds of the camp faded in my mind. The sounds of babies crying turned to a soft wail. The yelling of the kids turned to quiet murmmurs as I drifted into my mind.    For the past few weeks since we left Oklahoma   Ive been worried. Its been really rough living on the road without a proper home and I just really want the best for my family. The kids have been going to a public school just two miles from where wed been camping. Theyve told me that the kids have given them ugly looks and said awful things about them calling them Okies or saying they were retarded. I couldnt stand any of my kids having to go through this misfortune. I focused my vision on my two kids Annie and Joey. They were laughing and shoving some grass in the rabbits mouth. I didnt want them living like this but there was nothing I could do. I felt useless and weak.     The wind blew again and I went back to my daydreaming. My husband had been out for three days looking for any job available. We had planned to be at least in a home that put a roof over our heads but we accomplished nothing. Most of our close friends that had traveled with us already had a job and housing. The feeling bothered me. I looked around and saw some of the familes huddled under their tents. I dont want to be like this anymore I thought. But yet again there was nothing I could do. Sometimes I felt angry with myself. As if I wasnt trying my hardest   but eventually it would just turn to sorrow.     My thoughts were disrupted by Annie and Joey running up to me smiling. I looked down on them and smiled   wondering how lovely childhood must be with no worries.     Ma   when are we going to eat   Im starving? asked Joey.    Even I didnt know the answer to that question   we had completely run out of food. I pondered on how I would say this to them. I gave up and just said   I dont know Joey.  ,the cool afternoon wind brush against my face i watch a the kid play with a rabbit they have find in the wood all around me the sound of the camp fade in my mind the sound of baby cry turn to a soft wail the yelling of the kid turn to quiet murmmurs a i drift into my mind for the past few week since we leave oklahoma ive be worry it be really rough living on the road without a proper home and i just really want the best for my family the kid have be go to a public school just two mile from where wed be camp theyve tell me that the kid have give them ugly look and say awful thing about them call them okies or say they be retard i couldnt stand any of my kid have to go through this misfortune i focus my vision on my two kid annie and joey they be laugh and shove some grass in the rabbit mouth i didnt want them live like this but there be nothing i could do i felt useless and weak the wind blew again and i go back to my daydream my husband have be out for three day look for any job available we have plan to be at least in a home that put a roof over our head but we accomplish nothing most of our close friend that have travel with u already have a job and housing the feeling bother me i look around and saw some of the familes huddle under their tent i dont want to be like this anymore i think but yet again there be nothing i could do sometimes i felt angry with myself a if i wasnt try my hard but eventually it would just turn to sorrow my thought be disrupt by annie and joey run up to me smile i look down on them and smile wonder how lovely childhood must be with no worry ma when be we go to eat im starve ask joey even i didnt know the answer to that question we have completely run out of food i ponder on how i would say this to them i give up and just say i dont know joey,+ the cool afternoon wind brushed against my face .

8,One tiny black leg gracefully sweeps forward. Then five more identical legs immediately follow. The distance covered is just slightly over a mere quarter of an inch. Carried on its face is no discernible expression. The same face carried from the first introduction to oxygen. To freedom. To life. The little bug pauses shortly from its purposeful stride.    Yes indeed   there is much happening outside in the country of England. The year is 1587  and the month February. Everyone still wishes me to be married   but I do not think it a wise idea. Should I hand my country over to someone else who will recklessly run England? No. I owe it to my subjects to keep them safe as long as possible   and for as long as I am alive. I also at the moment need to keep my country safe from France and Spain who seem to be plotting against me   planning to take over this country.    However   my attention is focused on the bug. Such a frail   helpless looking character.    The task at hand requires only a signature from me. My name   written identically countless times before.  The consequence of signing this paper are far bigger than any paper put forth in my past existence   unfortunately. This time my signature means the death of a fellow human being. My cousin   Mary   the Scottish queen.    The bug continues its deliberate march forward   this time coming closer to the figure standing across from me   the woman reading the paper. It seems to glance upward at my huge figure looming over it. Threatening   but at the moment sitting still.    There is no question about what I must do. Mary has been kept in many different prisons here after being accused of plotting her husbands murder and after escaping prison in Scotland to come asking for my help. I had no choice but to keep her here. I have kept her here for over twenty years. I could not leave her helpless.    Now   however   Mary is guilty of high treason. She was found to be communicating with France and Spain. She has been devising plans with them to take over England. To let her live would be wrong. Nevertheless   she is a relative of mine. In addition   she is a queen. How can I put to death royalty? The hand belonging to none other than me has to sign the paper for her death. Is there a special term for me giving approval to Mary to be killed? Regret? Shame? Murder?    A hand seemingly unnoticed by the bug raises into the air.    My signature is the task at hand. My signature is Marys death. The tip of my quill pen finds its way to the paper. My heart beat finds its rate speeding up.     I look up just in time to see the hand of one of my guards falling   slicing through the air. A foot away from the table. Half a foot. Two inches.    The little bug looks upward at the hand falling above its back. It panics. The frail legs start to move as fast   and almost faster   than the bug knew it could. Not fast enough.    A cold chill runs down my back   causing my hand to shake at the impact of the other hand hitting the table. Of the other hand hitting the bug. I look down at my signature. Elizabeth. In the middle of the z   there is a tiny fault where my hand slipped. The bump is hardly noticeable to those who would glance at my signature in the future. However   engraved in my mind is my name holding the mistake in the z   holding the bugs death   and holding Marys death.  ,one tiny black leg gracefully sweep forward then five more identical leg immediately follow the distance cover be just slightly over a mere quarter of an inch carry on it face be no discernible expression the same face carry from the first introduction to oxygen to freedom to life the little bug pause shortly from it purposeful stride yes indeed there be much happen outside in the country of england the year be and the month february everyone still wish me to be marry but i do not think it a wise idea should i hand my country over to someone else who will recklessly run england no i owe it to my subject to keep them safe as long a possible and for as long a i be alive i also at the moment need to keep my country safe from france and spain who seem to be plot against me plan to take over this country however my attention be focus on the bug such a frail helpless look character the task at hand require only a signature from me my name write identically countless time before the consequence of sign this paper be far big than any paper put forth in my past existence unfortunately this time my signature mean the death of a fellow human be my cousin mary the scottish queen the bug continue it deliberate march forward this time come closer to the figure stand across from me the woman read the paper it seem to glance upward at my huge figure loom over it threaten but at the moment sit still there be no question about what i must do mary have be keep in many different prison here after be accuse of plot her husband murder and after escape prison in scotland to come ask for my help i have no choice but to keep her here i have keep her here for over twenty year i could not leave her helpless now however mary be guilty of high treason she be find to be communicate with france and spain she have be devise plan with them to take over england to let her live would be wrong nevertheless she be a relative of mine in addition she be a queen how can i put to death royalty the hand belong to none other than me have to sign the paper for her death be there a special term for me give approval to mary to be kill regret shame murder a hand seemingly unnoticed by the bug raise into the air my signature be the task at hand my signature be marys death the tip of my quill pen find it way to the paper my heart beat find it rate speed up i look up just in time to see the hand of one of my guard fall slice through the air a foot away from the table half a foot two inch the little bug look upward at the hand fall above it back it panic the frail legs start to move a fast and almost fast than the bug know it could not fast enough a cold chill run down my back cause my hand to shake at the impact of the other hand hit the table of the other hand hit the bug i look down at my signature elizabeth in the middle of the z there be a tiny fault where my hand slip the bump be hardly noticeable to those who would glance at my signature in the future however engrave in my mind be my name hold the mistake in the z hold the bug death and hold mary death,+ one tiny black leg gracefully sweeps forward . + then five more identical legs immediately follow . + the distance covered is just slightly over a mere quarter of an inch . + carried on its face is no discernible expression . + the same face carried from the first introduction to oxygen . + to freedom . + to life . + the little bug pauses shortly from its purposeful stride . + yes indeed there is much happening outside in the country of + england . + the year is 1587 and the month + february . + everyone still wishes me to be married but I do not think it a wise idea . + should I hand my country over to someone else who will recklessly run + england ? + no .

10,I was four years old when our house was destroyed. I didnt understand why but I could remember when the big red tractor came belching its smoke   gleaming in the hot midday sunshine   and rolling over the landscape plowing long furrows in perfect unison. Years later they told me it was the bank - the monster that lived and breathed profits from the land. We lived on that land and worked it until it was exhausted. I was still in the womb when the drought came with its monstrous black clouds of dust that enveloped the landscape. Pa said that the storms caused the land to be barren of profit. When the profit ceased   the bank found other means to satisfy its never-ending appetite for the financial food known to farmers as profit.    Ill never forget the day the bank took our house. Pa told me that the bank was cultivating the land because we could no longer sustain the profit ourselves. I did not know nor cared what it meant. I was just a kid playing Indians and Cowboys with my two brothers and sister the day the tractor came. The shiny monster had been plowing the land all day long when it finally got to our small cabin. My father put up a stand   but to no avail. The tractor driver delivered his monotonous address to Pa about the banks situation and needs. Legally it was fair   but it did not seem fair. Finally   Pa stepped away from the tractor squatted down and buried his head in his hands. Without hesitation   the driver fired up the incredible machine and let its engines roar. Looking back   the tractor driver seemed to have an ultimate connection with his machine because he was an obstinate man controlling an unstoppable force. Slowly   the machine approached the house as if it were not even there. At immediate contact   the walls and roof caved in as if it were a flimsy cardboard box against a freight train. The tractor then proceeded without a care in the world   unaware and unconcerned of the devastation left in the dust   as if there never was a house there.    Back then   I was merely a child watching and wondering what his father would do next. Pa had always been a strong man   a man that our family could depend on. However   in five minutes   the tractor was able to reduce Pa to nothing. Never before had I seen my father break down with hopelessness. Seeing him there without a plan made me feel as though we were alone in a desert with nowhere to turn. But the tractor   the arrogant tractor   took my small life and shattered it into million pieces   and left it on the ground in front of me. What few memories I had in that house flashed before me as I watch them knocked to the ground.

9,I slouch on the couch   comfortable in my favorite clothes   staring at the news anchor as he drones on about that disaster or this riot. A snow storm is supposed to be moving in tonight   the weatherman preaches. My dog Chloe lays curled up beside my feet   with her head propped on her leg. Shes our pure bred Brittney Spaniel recently adopted and already a special member of the family. As I push myself into the cushions   my feet nudge her a bit too much for her own taste. She then starts the slow process of standing up. She squints her eyes while she stretches out her leg   as if trying to grasp at some imaginary treasure on the floor. With hesitation she pushes herself up with her hind legs first. Walking out of the room as if she had completely forgotten me   she goes to check on her food that is so predictably there. I am amazed at how such an animal can keep to her schedule better than I do mine.    I then hear the all too familiar directive from my mother in the adjacent room. I have come to expect it   yet it still gets me agitated. I sink even deeper into the warm embrace of the couch   as if hearing nothing. I always delay as much as possible the dreaded task before me. After her third command   I wearily begin to pull myself away from the comfort that has enveloped me. Out the window the flakes form horizontal streaks as the wind blows furiously. As slowly as possible   I stretch out my arms and legs   not wanting to leave the peace of the room.    I trudge up the stairs to change into something appropriate for the task that lay before me. Now fully awake   I bound down the stairs. Searching for me gloves and hat   and finding none   I unwillingly grab my fathers worn knit cap   only to be stopped by my mother holding mine in her hand while she rolls her eyes. Reluctantly I pull the gloves over my hands   and my hat over my head. I stomp towards the door as Chloe bounds after me. Pulling down the leash and snapping it to her collar   I slowly open the door and step out into the dark cold.    Just then   the hard driving flakes seem to slow down   and light upon the dust covered world. I take a deep breath of the rich air   revitalizing me. Leaping down the steps   I begin the route that has become routine. With Chloe at the lead   no force but her adventurous spirit pulls me along. Passing her   she takes it as a sign to quicken her own pace. She soon starts into a gallop   pulling me along once again. I then hit full stride   keeping abreast of while running together as if that was all there was to do. We come around the next corner   and see the house in plain view. That quickly? It seems like only a few moments have passed before we begin to slow down. We both reluctantly slacken our pace into a slow trot   and then a flat out walk.    Panting   exhausted   we climb the stairs with no real drive. Opening the door I begin the arduous task of drying Chloe off. With an annoyed look on my face and an edge to my voice   I call to my mother to bring a towel. Through the door one sails toward me. Holding her tightly by the collar   I ruffle her with the towel until she is sufficiently dry. As soon as my grasp releases   she runs towards the kitchen to see my mother. I pull my hat and gloves off   and put them both in their proper place together. Removing the now wet boots   I bound up the stairs and change into my old clothes. I am soon back on the couch   with Chloe snuggled at my feet   I watch someone new talk about that political fiasco or this outbreak of malaria. With a pleased smile on my face   I push myself as far as possible into the cushions and change the channel.  ,i slouch on the couch comfortable in my favorite clothes star at the news anchor a he drone on about that disaster or this riot a snow storm be suppose to be move in tonight the weatherman preach my dog chloe lay curl up beside my foot with her head prop on her leg shes our pure breed brittney spaniel recently adopt and already a special member of the family a i push myself into the cushion my foot nudge her a bit too much for her own taste she then start the slow process of stand up she squint her eye while she stretch out her leg a if try to grasp at some imaginary treasure on the floor with hesitation she push herself up with her hind leg first walk out of the room a if she have completely forget me she go to check on her food that be so predictably there i be amaze at how such an animal can keep to her schedule well than i do mine i then hear the all too familiar directive from my mother in the adjacent room i have come to expect it yet it still get me agitate i sink even deeply into the warm embrace of the couch a if hear nothing i always delay as much a possible the dreaded task before me after her third command i wearily begin to pull myself away from the comfort that have envelop me out the window the flake form horizontal streak a the wind blow furiously as slowly a possible i stretch out my arm and legs not want to leave the peace of the room i trudge up the stair to change into something appropriate for the task that lay before me now fully awake i bind down the stair search for me glove and hat and find none i unwillingly grab my father wear knit cap only to be stop by my mother hold mine in her hand while she roll her eye reluctantly i pull the glove over my hand and my hat over my head i stomp towards the door a chloe bound after me pull down the leash and snap it to her collar i slowly open the door and step out into the dark cold just then the hard driving flake seem to slow down and light upon the dust cover world i take a deep breath of the rich air revitalize me leap down the step i begin the route that have become routine with chloe at the lead no force but her adventurous spirit pull me along pass her she take it a a sign to quicken her own pace she soon start into a gallop pull me along once again i then hit full stride keep abreast of while run together a if that be all there be to do we come around the next corner and see the house in plain view that quickly it seem like only a few moment have pass before we begin to slow down we both reluctantly slacken our pace into a slow trot and then a flat out walk pant exhaust we climb the stair with no real drive open the door i begin the arduous task of dry chloe off with an annoyed look on my face and an edge to my voice i call to my mother to bring a towel through the door one sail toward me hold her tightly by the collar i ruffle her with the towel until she be sufficiently dry as soon a my grasp release she run towards the kitchen to see my mother i pull my hat and glove off and put them both in their proper place together remove the now wet boot i bind up the stair and change into my old clothes i be soon back on the couch with chloe snuggle at my foot i watch someone new talk about that political fiasco or this outbreak of malaria with a pleased smile on my face i push myself as far a possible into the cushion and change the channel,I slouch on the couch comfortable in my favorite clothes staring at the news anchor as he drones on about that disaster or this riot .

10,Adam sat on the porch and watched the clear blue sky. Today was his sixth birthday and all he wanted was to watch the sunset. It was only noon and he had hours to go. Inside the house his mother was cooking and his father was out in the fields. He didnt mind being alone on his birthday. He liked the quiet.    He sensed it before he saw it. Something felt wrong. Everything was too quiet   much the same as the minutes before a hurricane. Those moments were magical. The world seemed to stand still; the air charged with electricity.    Waiting to explode into chaos.    Today was no different. A cloud that had not been present only seconds before covered the sun. Adam looked up and squinted into the still bright sky. The cloud covering the sun was alone. It would not be a thunderstorm. Suddenly a huge shadow loomed before him. It sped forward from the tree line and deftly made its way towards him.    Time slowed down and he watched as animals exploded from their hiding places. The wide yard was chaos as a hundred tiny bodies ran for cover. His breath caught in his throat and while he was afraid he could not tear his eyes away. There was something beautiful about the way the cloud of black dust crept towards him   swallowing everything in its path. To him it looked like a monster. Big and ugly and destructive and yet somehow extraordinary at the same time.     He vaguely registered that his name was being called   but there was nothing urgent enough to tear him away from the havoc unfolding before his eyes. He ignored the voices and watched as his mothers flowerbed was swallowed in seconds. Next were the tractor and then the shed. His big blue eyes grew wide as the cloud of angry   swirling black dust drew ever closer. His heart pounded now not from fear   but from something else. Adrenaline sang through his veins. It was exhilarating to watch his own death approach. He had no intention of dying today   but he couldnt bear to run inside and lose sight of this beautiful destruction.    The voices grew more and more frantic and the swirling mass of dust threatened closer and closer. And still Adam sat   watching and waiting for what was to be swallowed next. The shadow of this beast loomed over the house and he craned his head back to watch the hurricane of dust descend upon him. If possible time slowed even more. The door behind him burst open   the wood creaking and groaning in protest at the force shoved against it. The span of seconds in which his father ran towards him   shouting his name   stretched and seemed to become years. His footsteps pounded against the rotting planks of the porch   the noise exploding in Adams ears. He looked between his father and the black monster   which had now reached the bottom step.     His fathers strong arm reached towards him and closed around is body like a metal vice. His small bones jarred from the impact. He watched over his fathers shoulder as the storm wailed closer.    Ill catch you   it seemed to be mocking. As suddenly as time had slowed   it began again. The dust exploded around them just as his father slammed the door   shutting out the world. Black dust curled under the door and shifted forward in fury. His mother shoved a wet towel in the crack and pressed another to Adams face. Together   the three of them huddled in the middle of the room   gasping and hacking and choking for air. But Adam didnt mind. He had only one thought as the black dust wormed its way into his lungs and stole his breath.     That was better than the sunset.,adam sit on the porch and watch the clear blue sky today be his sixth birthday and all he want be to watch the sunset it be only noon and he have hour to go inside the house his mother be cook and his father be out in the field he didnt mind be alone on his birthday he like the quiet he sense it before he saw it something felt wrong everything be too quiet much the same a the minute before a hurricane those moment be magical the world seem to stand still the air charge with electricity wait to explode into chaos today be no different a cloud that have not be present only second before cover the sun adam look up and squint into the still bright sky the cloud cover the sun be alone it would not be a thunderstorm suddenly a huge shadow loom before him it speed forward from the tree line and deftly make it way towards him time slow down and he watch a animal explode from their hiding place the wide yard be chaos a a hundred tiny body run for cover his breath caught in his throat and while he be afraid he could not tear his eye away there be something beautiful about the way the cloud of black dust crept towards him swallow everything in it path to him it look like a monster big and ugly and destructive and yet somehow extraordinary at the same time he vaguely register that his name be be call but there be nothing urgent enough to tear him away from the havoc unfold before his eye he ignore the voice and watch a his mother flowerbed be swallow in second next be the tractor and then the shed his big blue eye grow wide a the cloud of angry swirl black dust draw ever closer his heart pound now not from fear but from something else adrenaline sang through his vein it be exhilarate to watch his own death approach he have no intention of die today but he couldnt bear to run inside and lose sight of this beautiful destruction the voice grow more and more frantic and the swirl mass of dust threaten closer and closer and still adam sat watching and wait for what be to be swallow next the shadow of this beast loom over the house and he crane his head back to watch the hurricane of dust descend upon him if possible time slow even more the door behind him burst open the wood creaking and groaning in protest at the force shove against it the span of second in which his father run towards him shout his name stretch and seem to become year his footstep pound against the rot plank of the porch the noise exploding in adams ear he look between his father and the black monster which have now reach the bottom step his father strong arm reach towards him and close around be body like a metal vice his small bone jar from the impact he watch over his father shoulder a the storm wail close ill catch you it seem to be mock as suddenly a time have slow it begin again the dust explode around them just a his father slam the door shut out the world black dust curl under the door and shift forward in fury his mother shove a wet towel in the crack and press another to adams face together the three of them huddle in the middle of the room gasping and hacking and choke for air but adam didnt mind he have only one thought a the black dust worm it way into his lung and steal his breath that be good than the sunset,+ adam sat on the porch and watched the clear blue sky . + today was his sixth birthday and all he wanted was to watch the sunset . + it was only noon and he had hours to go . + inside the house his mother was cooking and his father was out in the fields . + he didnt mind being alone on his birthday . + he liked the quiet . + he sensed it before he saw it . + something felt wrong . + everything was too quiet much the same as the minutes before a hurricane . + those moments were magical . + the world seemed to stand still ; the air charged with electricity . + waiting to explode into chaos . + today was no different .

10,I was six years old when my mother ran off with the pizza delivery boy. She sent a note in the mail to my grandmother that read   Katies at home. Needs food and clothing. Jane. Gramma drove the one-thousand-seven-hundred-twenty miles from Kansas to pick me up   pulling into the trailer lot in her blue   wood-paneled station wagon   slamming the car door behind her. I was sitting in a rusty hubcap on the from lawn   my chin cupped in my palm and my heart thundering wildly when she said   Well   Im here.    She wore a pink silk handkerchief around the beehive of her blue-tinted hair   a paisley mu-mu and orange scuffs on her feet. Red   plastic-rimmed glasses hung from the chain around her neck and a cigarette dangled from the corner of her pink-painted mouth. She was terrifying.    She was perfect.    She crossed the front lawn without saying a word   opening the door to the trailer as she looked back   once   for me to comply. I followed her   remaining stubbornly   apprehensively   at the front door. She bustled around the house   bundling up all my clothes and typing them with a piece of twine she found heaped in the back of her Buick. Before she decided it was time to leave   she trussed me up in my snow gear   explaining tersely   Its cold in Kansas this time of year.    I had been sifting inside the trailer   alone   for three days. Leaving for Kansas was the most spectacular adventure I could imagine   so wondrous I could barely believe it was real. She hauled me into the Buick   grunting at the dead weight of my tense body   and we sat on the leather bench seat of her car as she let it idle in the lot. She was flicking cigarette ashes out the open window when I mustered up the nerve to pinch her   just to make sure I wasnt dreaming.    What--? she narrowed her gaze at me   dragging on the cigarette so the tip gleamed in a bright orange O between her lips.    Youre real   I whispered in wonder.    As much as you are   she huffed   tossing the cigarette from the car and cranking up the window. Just dont make a habit of pinching people to test out that theory   â€˜kay   Sugar? She rammed the car into reverse and sped away from the lot. The pieces of my childhood were fading as fast as the scenery   and yet I was filled with a sense of bone-deep elation. For the first time in three days   I smiled.    I saw Gramma cut a look at me out of  the corner of her eye   and nod. She glanced back at the road when she pulled the slip of paper from her pocket   and said   Its all youve got of your momma   so I figured youd want to keep it.    I was six   and I couldnt read the words my mother had hastily scrawled on a grocery receipt   but I kept that piece of paper fisted in my hand all along the roads to Kansas. Gramma   I whispered after a few hours   barely awake and suddenly terrified   are you ever gonna bring me home.    I could see her eyes in the passing lights of oncoming cars   watching them fill up with giant   watery tears   saw them go soft and achy. Oh   Katydid   she murmured gently   reaching out in the darkness to clutch the fist that held my mothers letter.

10,In the real world   I am insecure. I walk down the halls of my high school trying to project an image of confidence and self-respect. Despite my concentrated attempts   I feel neither of these. Like everyone else   I want to be liked   admired   and respected   the kind of person that everyone thinks well of. This desire to be accepted taints my personality   causing an aspect of me to emerge that is not anything close to the reality of my character. Sometimes I can talk to a person and laugh with that person for a long time   but that person still has no idea of who I am. They havent even scratched the surface   but its not their fault. I cant expect anyone to become acquainted with me when insecurity urges me to put on the face that I know they want to see. In my life of lies   I have one truth. It is something I can never lie about how much I love   no matter whom I talk to. I can never ignore the fact that it and it alone pulls me out and makes me real. When I am on stage I may be playing a character that isnt myself   but I   for once   am living the truth.    My head is bent down   concentrating on the slippery   uncooperative strings of the hoop tied around my waist. I suck my stomach in   trying to avoid the inevitable moment when the safety pin that holds the thin fabric together will pop open and stab my belly button. The hoop flares outward from my waist   just brushing the ground at my feet. It is a pale gray   with irregular white splotches scattered throughout. The tissue paper thin fabric holds its hoop shape with the aid of three wicker circles glued to the inside. My corset sucks my torso in and pushes it up in all the right places   making me feel feminine in the old-fashioned way. My bare shoulders display a faint bathing suit line   partially covered by the wavy tumble of pale hair across my face. My arms are bent at the elbow   my hands a faint blur as I struggle with my hoop skirt. The outline of my body stands out clearly from the dark of the risers stacked behind me. A gaudy assortment of costume pieces are sprinkled across the top of the risers   awaiting attention or use.  My beat-up sneakers are visible a few feet away   unwelcome reminders of the tenth grader in jeans and a sweatshirt who had first reached for the hoop skirt and corset ten minutes ago. The rest of my  costume is draped carefully behind me   almost slipping to a puddle of silk on the carpet. In a moment   I will emerge from behind the curtain and   arms in the air   wiggle the cool   smooth dress over my head   completing the physical transformation to my character. But for the moment   I am engaged in the difficult task of securing my hoop   the most integral aspect of my costume.    I loved the costume more than anything. In my opinion   it was the best thing to ever come out of the U-32 costume closet. I loved the feeling of the swishy layers of skirts swaying back and forth as I stalked across the auditorium   and the smooth touch of the satiny cloth against my back and arms. I felt as though I had become the six-year old version of me   playing dress-up in my best friends attic. I used to find the most glamorous   beautiful outfits I could   and then prance downstairs and find some adoring grown-up to show off for. My friends and I would have costume parades   and if we were at my house   Id beg my mother to take pictures of us posing together. As a little six-year-old   I would have killed for this costume   and lets just say that ten years later   nothing had changed.    The hour before each show is filled with a high concentration of pre-show adrenaline   the imminence of the performance causing a delicious tension that hangs in the air. The cast and the crew rush madly around   trying to accomplish a thousand things that all seem to be   at the last minute   the deciding factor in the quality of the play. Costumes are pinned or sewed   makeup is slathered on by the spongefull   and props are set in their places or searched for. Everything combined created chaos   but in the beautiful way you only appreciated after its over. As we all try to do warm-ups in our crazy and uncooperative costumes   I stare around the auditorium   visualizing the people that will soon fill its seats. My gaze flickers up to the stage   the beautiful stage   and I picture our story unfolding across its face. I smile as I bend first to the right and the then to the left   wishing that the pure excitement and nervous anticipation I was experiencing could be bottled and saved for later enjoyment.    My performance energy carries me to my spot backstage where I attentively list to the audience commotion as I squeeze the clammy hands of my fellow cast members. Then the moment comes when the lights dim and the audience falls into a unanimous hush   just in time for the best sound of all   the opening of the curtain. The stage lights up and the reality of the audience world gives way to focus on the set and the actors that enter our new world of the play.    I stand perfectly still backstage   my eyes tightly closed   listening attentively for Tamsens line to bring me on. I am silently mouthing the words along with her   but I jump a little when I hear it anyway. And now for something a tad delightful   a bit decadent   and a little devilishâ€¦the Duchess of Dressing Up! The Duchess of Dressing Up raises her chin   ignoring the momentary was of butterflies and the goosebumps that cover her arms as she moves onto the stage. I eagerly soak up the bright lights and the knowledge that everyone is watching me. I revel in this awareness   allowing the audience presence to enhance my acting. I shut of all access to my ***ness and become someone else. My alter ego. My other half. My stage self. Each moment I spend on stage pulls more out of my character   forcing me to focus and perform as hard as I can. I am in heaven.    Being on stage infuses me with a special feeling that I have grown o love fiercely over the years. It lends me the confidence and the self-respect that I constantly seek whenever Im offstage   out of the light. I feel like a fish in water; I am in my element. If I am on stage   I am happy   whether Im front and center or somewhere out in the distant downstage right. When I say a line   people listen to me   and I can do whatever I want because its not me. Its someone else. With that feeling of becoming another person   I can get away with anything. Only then am I truly confident.    As I stand behind the curtain   my fingers fumbling with my skirt and my hair cascading over my face   I am not on stage   but I am still happy. I am myself   caught in a moment of unawareness   caught in a moment of pure existence and not of performance.,in the real world i be insecure i walk down the hall of my high school try to project an

2,Dear Mr. Davis: You should serve chocolate milk because it has 0% fat just like 0% fat white milk. Another reason is some kids will only drink chocolate milk. Another reason is both kinds of milk have the same amount of protein (8 grams) and calcium. Protein gives you energy   and calcium makes your bones stronger. Chocolate milk is still really healthy even though it has chocolate in it.,dear mr davis you should serve chocolate milk because it have fat just like fat white milk another reason be some kid will only drink chocolate milk another reason be both kind of milk have the same amount of protein gram and calcium protein give you energy and calcium make your bone strong chocolate milk be still really healthy even though it have chocolate in it,+ dear + mr . + davis : + you should serve chocolate milk because it has 0 % fat just like 0 % fat white milk . + another reason is some kids will only drink chocolate milk . + another reason is both kinds of milk have the same amount of protein ( 8 grams ) and calcium . + protein gives you energy and calcium makes your bones stronger . + chocolate milk is still really healthy even though it has chocolate in it . 
2,I think that Thomas Alva Edison is the most important person that we read about because he invented the electric light bulb. Back a long time ago   we did not have the electric light bulb. We had candles. If we did not have the electric light bulb   we would have more fires. It would be a lot darker than it is with the electric light bulb. How would kids do homework in the dark?

3,I do not think school should be year round. Do you think school should be year round?       Without summer vacation   students would not be able to go on family vacations. If a student wanted to go to a sleep away camp   they would not be able to do it. At camp you learn how to do things on your own. If school was year round   older siblings would not have time to teach younger siblings how to swing or climb trees. Teachers would also not have time for vacation.  Even if you are not at school   you can still learn things. Teachers can also learn things outside of school.  Kids need to get their energy out. They can get it out by doing big races. In summer it is very hot indoors and children would be thinking about outside   and not school. Children usually like warm or hot weather.  I know that towards the end of the year   I look forward to summer vacation and I think other children do too!

3,Are you looking for a new pet? Id recommend a cat. For one thing   they arent that expensive. You could find one on your porch and adopt it. Cats usually bathe themselves. Cats will sleep with you and can help you calm down when youre upset or mad. Cats also dont need training and you can leave cats home for the day. Cats dont need much exercise.

4,Wow! I Am Glad We Have Zoos!      There should be zoos because they save animals and help people learn a lot about animals. Did you know thirty species of animals were saved because of zoos? Zoos give great care that most animals dont receive in the wild. I am so glad that there are zoos to save animals. What would we do without them?    There should be zoos because zookeepers give so much care to the animals. There are no longer cages   and the fences are hidden   so the animals feel like theyre in the wild. Zoos make sure to hide the animals food so they can learn to hunt. Sometimes theres tinted glass so the animals cant see all the chaos going on. I am so glad the zookeepers give their time to care for the animals. Thank goodness we have zoos!    Without zoos   a lot of animals could have become extinct. Zoos are trying to solve the problem of extinction   and theyre doing a great job! Animals such as red wolves were saved. Zoos take a male and a female so they can have babies. This makes more animals of its kind. When animals mate in zoos   their babies wont get diseases from the wild. Zoos are trying to stop extinction   and theyre doing great.    When visiting a zoo   you can learn so much. You are able to see animals from faraway places without paying for  a $200 plane ticket. Zoos are a great way to learn and have fun. Not only do the customers learn at zoos   but the workers do   tooâ€”about animal behavior and how to make animal habitats better. Thank goodness zoos are here so we can learn a lot about different animals.    Zoos benefit both people and animals. We could help by going to a zoo and paying a fee to get in. When we do that   all the money goes to the zoo and animals. It is important that we have zoos to help kids learn while they are having fun and seeing the animals in person. With your help   zoos can support a lot of animals. So   with that said   the next time you do not know what to do   go to a zoo! ,wow i be glad we have zoos there should be zoos because they save animal and help people learn a lot about animal do you know thirty specie of animal be save because of zoo zoo give great care that most animal dont receive in the wild i be so glad that there be zoo to save animal what would we do without them there should be zoos because zookeepers give so much care to the animal there be no long cage and the fence be hide so the animal feel like theyre in the wild zoo make sure to hide the animal food so they can learn to hunt sometimes there tint glass so the animal cant see all the chaos go on i be so glad the zookeepers give their time to care for the animal thank goodness we have zoos without zoo a lot of animal could have become extinct zoo be try to solve the problem of extinction and theyre do a great job animal such a red wolf be save zoo take a male and a female so they can have baby this make more animal of it kind when animal mate in zoo their baby wont get disease from the wild zoo be try to stop extinction and theyre do great when visit a zoo you can learn so much you be able to see animal from faraway place without pay for a plane ticket zoo be a great way to learn and have fun not only do the customer learn at zoo but the worker do too about animal behavior and how to make animal habitat well thank goodness zoo be here so we can learn a lot about different animal zoos benefit both people and animal we could help by go to a zoo and pay a fee to get in when we do that all the money go to the zoo and animal it be important that we have zoos to help kid learn while they be have fun and see the animal in person with your help zoo can support a lot of animal so with that say the next time you do not know what to do go to a zoo,+ wow !

5,Cats and dogs can be very entertaining. But when it comes down to the best pet   I would say the dog.  One reason why I think dogs are the best pets to have is because you can talk to them and they listen to you. You can tell them secrets and how you feel. Kind of like a personal journal   except they actually hear what youre saying.  Another reason why I think a dog is the best pet to have is because a dog can warn you of danger   and sometimes that danger might be life threatening. So   with a dog   its like you have your own danger alarm.  Also another reason why I think dogs are the best pets to have is that they keep you company. They are perfect pets to have if you love company. And with dogs   its almost like you are having your best friends over. And better yet   if you own the dog   and its a weekday   its like your friends are spending the night on a school night.    Another reason why I think a dog is the best pet to have is because they need to get exercise. You will have to walk your dog every day. So   even if you dont like to walk   your dog and you will be getting automatic exercise. This will make you and your dog healthier.    Cats and dogs are very unique in their own fascinating way. But if I had to choose between the both of them   I would go for the dog. Even though dogs require lots of responsibility and need maintenance and training   they are still worth the effort. Most importantly   a dog is like a best friend.       ,cat and dog can be very entertaining but when it come down to the best pet i would say the dog one reason why i think dog be the best pet to have be because you can talk to them and they listen to you you can tell them secret and how you feel kind of like a personal journal except they actually hear what youre say another reason why i think a dog be the best pet to have be because a dog can warn you of danger and sometimes that danger might be life threaten so with a dog it like you have your own danger alarm also another reason why i think dog be the best pet to have be that they keep you company they be perfect pet to have if you love company and with dog it almost like you be have your best friend over and good yet if you own the dog and it a weekday it like your friend be spend the night on a school night another reason why i think a dog be the best pet to have be because they need to get exercise you will have to walk your dog every day so even if you dont like to walk your dog and you will be get automatic exercise this will make you and your dog healthier cat and dog be very unique in their own fascinating way but if i have to choose between the both of them i would go for the dog even though dog require lot of responsibility and need maintenance and training they be still worth the effort most importantly a dog be like a best friend,+ cats and dogs can be very entertaining . + but when it comes down to the best pet I would say the dog . + one reason why I think dogs are the best pets to have is because you can talk to them and they listen to you . + you can tell them secrets and how you feel . + kind of like a personal journal except they actually hear what youre saying . + another reason why I think a dog is the best pet to have is because a dog can warn you of danger and sometimes that danger might be life threatening . + so with a dog its like you have your own danger alarm . + also another reason why I think dogs are the best pets to have is that they keep you company . + they are perfect pets to have if you love company . + and with dogs its almost like you are having your best friends over . + and better yet if you own the dog and its a weekday its like your friends are spending the night on a school night . + another reason why I think a dog is the best pet to have is because they need to get exercise . + you will have to walk your dog every day . + so even if you dont like to walk your dog and you will be getting automatic exercise . + this will make you and your dog healthier . + cats and dogs are very unique in their own fascinating way . + but if I had to choose between the both of them I would go for the dog . + even though dogs require lots of responsibility and need maintenance and training they are still worth the effort . + most importantly a dog is like a best friend . 
5,Deep in the arctic   a mother polar is returning from a long   hard day of hunting. Looking ahead she sees the ice floes she uses to get home are much farther apart. It will be a lot harder to make it home. She jumps in and swims for it   but pretty soon becomes exhausted. Just when she cant make it any further   another ice floe appears. She barely made it.      Sadly   not all polar bears are this lucky. The North Polar ice caps are melting rapidly   causing all sorts of problems needing grave attention. The cause of this problem I can sum up in two words. Global warming. Global warming is caused by carbon dioxide and other air pollution thats collecting and trapping the suns heat. Many of us never dream that little things like driving a car and turning on the lights could be part of the reason this planet is warming up. Scientists believe that U.S. temperatures could be 3 to 9 degrees higher by the end of the century. To make matters worse   global warming doesnt only affect polar bears   but people and places all over the world. It is crucial we take action against global warming and all the issues it has caused before its too late.    Global warming is a huge problem most people dont seem to be aware of. And the environment is just one of the things changing around us. Things never heard of before are jeopardizing our planet. In 2002  Colorado   Arizona   and Oregon suffered through one of the worst wildfire seasons ever. At the same time   Montana and Texas endured droughts that were creating dust storms. And to add to all these rugged weather changes   just the next year  2003  extreme heat waves caused more than 20 000 deaths in Europe and more than 1 500 deaths in India. Talk about changing climate!    And Im only getting started. Lets go back to the polar bears. As I briefly mentioned before   in the Arctic and Antarctic dramatic changes are happening. Even though the Arctic is a region meant to stay frozen 365 days a year   the ice cap is melting rapidly. Unless we stop releasing greenhouse gases   the polar ice cap will completely disappear each year during summertime. In the book An Inconvenient Truth   it clearly states   This is a dangerous situation for all of us   because the Arctic ice cap plays a very crucial role in cooling the entire planet. We are in a very serious position. We must stop Global Warming!    As Al Gore once said   Each one of us is a cause of global warming   but each of us can become part of the solutionâ€¦   It isnt too late to stop global warming   or at least slow it down a bit. And who better than us   the cause of this awful problem   to do just that?    Tell me   how often do you use your car? Dont get me wrong   I dont want you to stop using it completely   but cars are the 2nd largest source of global warming. Cars burn off tons carbon dioxide. This creates a hole in the ozone layer. Very   VERY strong sunlight shines through the hole   which contributes to global warming.    One quick and easy way to save money and gas is to carpool with your friends and family. That way instead of the pollution from 2 cars   it will be just one! Or even better   buy a hybrid car! These energy efficient cars have gas electric engines and cut global warming pollution by one third or moreâ€”much better then Hummers and SUVs. The popularity of these cars has generated a 20% increase in transportation-related carbon dioxide pollution.    Its hard to believe that something as simple as the light bulb could play a major role in global warming. But there is a way to save energy for everything. Instead of picking an incandescent light bulb   choose a compact fluoresant one instead. Youll lower your energy bill AND keep nearly 700 pounds of carbon dioxide out of the air. How about that   a way to save money   and the environment! Another way to reduce carbon dioxide pollution is to take a chance and try a refrigerator with the Energy Star label. That indicates it uses at least 15 percent less energy than the federal requirement. Try to make everything you do one more step towards solving global warming. Every little thing counts.    If we want our children to grow up in a carefree   healthy world   we need to start working toward it now. We are not just hurting the earth   but hurting ourselves and the way we live. Some of it we cant help   but most of it we can and should try to change. When so much has already been lost to us   think how life might be in a few years. In the words of Al Goreâ€”  It is our only home.  And we must take care of it.      ,deep in the arctic a mother polar be return from a long hard day of hunt look ahead she see the ice floes she use to get home be much farther apart it will be a lot

10,To whom it may concern:   A group of parents   and some teachers   have made a proposal to the school board. They would like the school to participate in the national Shut Down Your Screen Week.  A week without any electronics is what parents believe the school needs. Technology is a big contradiction. It is useful with all the tools it has   yet it can be a distraction   or addicting. Our school should participate in the national Shut Down Your Screen Week because of the following issues with technology.   Based on a representative survey of 2 500 Americansâ€¦those who used social media had more close confidants   says Keith Hampton. Facebook   Twitter   and other social media allow people to connect with each other and have social interactions   but through the web. The web   or a phone   that allows people to be more social is a major issue today. Kids   especially high school students   feel no need to talk to a friend in person. They can just text them. The problem with Facebook   or texting   is that people interact differently than they would in person. Cyberbullying is one of the biggest issues with the web today. People say things on the web that they wouldnt say to the persons face. Bullies feel safe when hidden behind a screen. Whether or not the survey of 2 500 people was accurate   it still did not account for the differences in interactions for media and in person. Having no electronics for a week would allow students to see that difference.   Although technology allows students to do research   that research isnt helping students to do strategic and logical thinking. What really makes us intelligent isnt our ability to find lots of information quickly. Its our ability to think deeply about that information    says Nicholas Carr   author of the book The Shallows: What the Internet is Doing to Our Brains. Brain scientists have researched and found out that deep thinking only happens with a calm mind.  The greater our concentration   the richer our thoughts   Nicholas Carr says. The internet is a useful search engine   but does not allow students to go deeply into thought. Google allows people to find anything by the click of a button. This isnt the way students should learn. Nicholas Carr says   If youre really interested in developing your mind   you should turn off your computer and your cellphone â€“ and start thinking. Really thinking.   Technology can be distracting   but most of all it is addictive. Scientists say that using email   texting   or searching the web can change how someone thinks or behaves. The stimulation [of technology use] provokes excitement â€“ a dopamine squirt â€“ that researchers say can be addictive. In its absence   people feel bored   says Matt Richtel of the New York Times. Addiction to technology may not compare to the addiction of certain drugs   but being a student who is addicted to something that creates different social interactions   and doesnt allow deep thought   could be very bad. In 2008  people consumed three times as much [technology] each day as they did in 1960   Matt says.  This rate has already increased   and a break from it wouldnt be a bad thing. Researchers worry that constant digital stimulation like this creates attention problems for children with brains that are still developing   who already struggle to set priorities and resist impulses   Matt says. Students in high school   or even in college   have brains that are still developing. A week off from the technology would allow these students to develop skills   with their growing brains   that could be used instead of electronics.   Our school should start participating in the national Shut Down Your Screen Week. It would allow students to see the difference in social interactions of electronics and in person.   The week would allow students to go into deep thought and understand subjects and ideas that Google cannot.

9,To Teachers and Whom It May Concern:    A proposal has been brought to the school board concerning the possibility of participating in Shut Down Your Screen Week   a movement in which students do not use any electronic media for a seven day duration. Technology and electronic media have been shown to have a variety of negative impacts on people   especially youth. For this reason   I believe that participating in Shut Down Your Screen Week would benefit our students in a variety of ways.  There are many negative impacts of electronic media upon our students   but among the most severe is its effects on the brain. According to the article   Attached to Technology and Paying a Price   technology is rewiring our brains. Technology has been proven to have significant effects on the way brains take in and process information. Thats not surprising considering people use an average of 12 hours a day (one half of every day) of media each day. The brain behaves hyperactively while using electronic media   as it is presented with a deluge of data. This hyperactivity transfers into ones daily life   causing troubles focusing   forgetfulness   and boredom. A break from social media and technology would help students become more focused and attentive   giving their brains a break from technology.  Additionally   students could better obtain information without technology or social media. High-result-yielding search engines are not the most productive way for students to take in information. When a brain is using a computer   it is taking in a great amount of information quickly. According to the article   Is Google Making Us Stupid? deep thinking happens only when our minds are calm and attentive. With an overload of information   the brain is not at all calm and does not deeply interpret information.  Although search engines like Google may present much information   with its use   little information will be internalized   and little knowledge will be gained. During a week without technology   students could gain and truly internalize knowledge.  I do understand that there are many benefits of technology in education. I understand that technology can help students efficiently find information   and technology has even shown signs of growing neural circuitry in brains   according to Attached to Technology and Paying the Price. Additionally   according to the article Is Google Making Us Stupid? the efficiency of search engines outweigh the distractions. Due to the positive aspects of technology and social media   I would not suggest that the school remove technology or social media for good. I believe that   since technology is so addictive   it would be beneficial to students to experience a week without it. During this time   students would be more focused   attentive   and better internalize information   along with innumerable other benefits.   Thank you for your time   and I hope that you will consider my proposal. ,to teacher and whom it may concern a proposal have be bring to the school board concern the possibility of participate in shut down your screen week a movement in which student do not use any electronic medium for a seven day duration technology and electronic medium have be show to have a variety of negative impact on people especially youth for this reason i believe that participate in shut down your screen week would benefit our student in a variety of way there be many negative impact of electronic medium upon our student but among the most severe be it effect on the brain accord to the article attach to technology and pay a price technology be rewire our brain technology have be prove to have significant effect on the way brain take in and process information thats not surprising consider people use an average of hour a day one half of every day of medium each day the brain behaves hyperactively while use electronic medium a it be present with a deluge of data this hyperactivity transfer into one daily life cause trouble focus forgetfulness and boredom a break from social medium and technology would help student become more focused and attentive give their brain a break from technology additionally student could better obtain information without technology or social medium high result yield search engine be not the most productive way for student to take in information when a brain be use a computer it be take in a great amount of information quickly accord to the article be google make u stupid deep thinking happen only when our mind be calm and attentive with an overload of information the brain be not at all calm and do not deeply interpret information although search engine like google may present much information with it use little information will be internalize and little knowledge will be gain during a week without technology student could gain and truly internalize knowledge i do understand that there be many benefit of technology in education i understand that technology can help student efficiently find information and technology have even show sign of grow neural circuitry in brain accord to attach to technology and pay the price additionally accord to the article be google make u stupid the efficiency of search engine outweigh the distraction due to the positive aspect of technology and social medium i would not suggest that the school remove technology or social medium for good i believe that since technology be so addictive it would be beneficial to student to experience a week without it during this time student would be more focused attentive and good internalize information along with innumerable other benefit thank you for your time and i hope that you will consider my proposal,+ to + teachers and + whom + it + may + concern : A proposal has been brought to the school board concerning the possibility of participating in + shut + down + your + screen + week a movement in which students do not use any electronic media for a seven day duration . + technology and electronic media have been shown to have a variety of negative impacts on people especially youth . + for this reason I believe that participating in + shut + down + your + screen + week would benefit our students in a variety of ways . + there are many negative impacts of electronic media upon our students but among the most severe is its effects on the brain . + according to the article + attached to + technology and + paying a + price technology is rewiring our brains . + technology has been proven to have significant effects on the way brains take in and process information . + thats not surprising considering people use an average of 12 hours a day ( one half of every day ) of media each day . + the brain behaves hyperactively while using electronic media as it is presented with a deluge of data . + this hyperactivity transfers into ones daily life causing troubles focusing forgetfulness and boredom .

6,Having complicated characters in a book makes the story more interesting   as well as enjoyable to read. Tom Sawyer is one of those kinds of characters that is very complicated and sometimes hard to put into one group   such as likable or dislikable.      The book Tom Sawyer   by Mark Twain   is about a boy   age twelve   named Tom who lives in a small town in Missouri. He lives with his Aunt   Aunt Polly. The Mississippi River   which runs very close to the town is often the center of the excitement. The story is about how Tom grows up in the small town   and the adventures he and his friends have.      I think that even though Tom does do some very brave and admirable things   the author   Mark Twain   wants us to think of Tom as a character to dislike. For example   Tom often gets his friends into trouble. Also   Tom does sometimes steal things. When it is little things he is stealing   like a doughnut from Aunt Polly   it seems okay. But when it is bigger things from somebody else   it is a big deal because whatever he stole could be important to that person   or it could be necessary for them to survive.      However   Tom is not only dislikable. He has done some very good things and it is easy to see why many people would like him. For example   even when Tom runs away to be a pirate   he still feels that he should say his prayers   even though nobody is there to tell him he has to. He can also be very kind to his friends   and help them when they are stuck in difficult situations   or when they are in trouble.      One example of Tom being kind to his friends is the time when his friend Becky is in big trouble. She accidentally ripped the school Masters book   that she was not even supposed to open. When the schoolmaster found out that someone had ripped the book   he was furious. He began to ask the students one by one   who had done it. When he came to Becky   Tom knew she would not be able to keep the secret   so he jumped up and yelled   I done it! That is an example of a time when Tom did a very brave thing   by taking the blame for Becky.      Another example of how Tom could be considered a likable character is when Tom ran off to be a pirate with his friends   Joe Harper and Huckleberry Finn. Even though they had run off so no one could tell them what to do   they found themselves feeling bad about the things they had stolen. They also felt they should still say their prayers   even though nobody was there to tell them to. That shows that even though he had run away to become a pirate   he is still good.      A third example of how Tom could be considered as a good person is the time when he saved Becky in the cave. It really was his fault that they got lost in the first place   because he lead them further and further in the cave. But in the end   he saved her. He left her and let her sleep   and he traveled around the cave and eventually he found an entrance out. He then went back into the cave to find her. Then he makes his way back with her   and they both are able to escape the cave. It was brave of Tom to go back into the cave for Becky.      A last example of Tom acting as the kind of character you would admire is the time when Tom was going to leave a note for Aunt Polly saying that he was not dead   and had only run away. But Tom did not end up leaving the note. However   he did kiss Aunt Polly in her sleep   before leaving. This shows that even though Tom ran away   he still cares about Aunt Polly   and that is good.  However   although Tom does show some examples of being a likable character   he shows even more examples of being dislikable. One example of this is when Tom and Huck witness Injun Joe murder Dr. Robinson. Huck and Tom swear not ever to tell anyone about the murder. Later   Tom breaks the vow   and confesses in front of everyone. But Huck never broke the vow   and in some ways Tom betrayed him. Also   if Tom and Huck had told earlier   but this time agreed to both tell   Muff Potter would not have been falsely accused of murder. If Muff Potter had been proven innocent by Tom and Huck   he would not be in jail for nearly as long as he was   if at all.       Another example of Tom as a dislikable character is the day he meets the new boy. Almost the minute Tom meets him   they are in a fight. Tom ends up winning   and he beats up the new boy badly. That was a pretty mean thing for Tom to do   especially when it is the new kid.      Another time   Tom steals a whole leg of a ham. He and his friends are playing a game   and Tom takes a ham from a family. That much ham is a lot of meat   and for many families back then   that much meat could last the whole winter. It was a really terrible thing to do   because whoever he stole the meat from   might even need it to survive. Tom should never have stolen that meat. His friends too had taken things like fish or bacon from other families.       A third example of Tom doing something that the reader would think of as a dislikable thing about Tom   is again   the time when Tom   Huck   and Joe run away. Tom knows that Aunt Polly is worried sick   and very sad. But Tom and his friends dont even leave a note to their parents   or anything to let them know that they are okay. That is a very cruel thing to do to them   to keep them waiting   thinking the boys are dead.       But the most dislikable thing about Tom is the way Tom takes advantage of his friends. One example of this is when Tom is given the job of whitewashing the fence. Tom tricks his friends into doing his chore. He makes the job seem important by telling his friends that they would not be able to do a good enough job at it. They beg him and they trade him all sorts of things to do his job   and he knows he is being mean   and tricking them. Then Aunt Polly gives him an apple for the good work   that he didnt even do   but he steals a doughnut from her anyway. Later   when Tom goes to Sunday school   he gives his friends back the things they traded him to whitewash the fence   in exchange for bible tickets. The Sunday School gives out a blue ticket for every two verses memorized. Ten blue tickets equaled one red ticket   ten reds equals one yellow   and for ten yellow tickets you got  a copy of the bible. Tom traded his whitewashing earnings for enough tickets for a bible. Then in front of the whole Sunday school Tom receives a bible. I think that is a truly nasty thing to do. He basically cheated to get the bible   and he cheated his friends.      Overall   Tom Sawyer is a complicated character that the author wants us to think of as a dislikable one. Although Tom does do things that are likable   the dislikable ones outweigh it. A lot can be learned from Tom about peoples characteristics   and about what they are really like.,have complicate character in a book make the story more interesting as well a enjoyable to read tom sawyer be one of those kind of character that be very complicated and sometimes hard to put into one group such a likable or dislikable the book tom sawyer by mark twain be about a boy age twelve name tom who live in a small town in missouri he live with his aunt aunt polly the mississippi river which run very close to the town be often the center of the excitement the story be about how tom grow up in the small town and the adventure he and his friend have i think that even though tom do do some very brave and admirable thing the author mark twain want u to think of tom a a character to dislike for example tom often get his friend into trouble also tom do sometimes steal thing when it be little thing he be steal like a doughnut from aunt polly it seem okay but when it be big thing from somebody else it be a big deal because whatever he steal could be important to that person or it could be necessary for them to survive however tom be not only dislikable he have do some very good thing and it be easy to see why many people would like him for example even when tom run away to be a pirate he still feel that he should say his prayer even though nobody be there to tell him he have to he can also be very kind to his friend and help them when they be stick in difficult situation or when they be in trouble one example of tom be kind to his friend be the time when his friend becky be in big trouble she accidentally rip the school master book that she be not even suppose to open when the schoolmaster find out that someone have rip the book he be furious he begin to ask the student one by one who have do it when he come to becky tom knew she would not be able to keep the secret so he jump up and yell i do it that be an example of a time when tom do a very brave thing by take the blame for becky another example of how tom could be consider a likable character be when tom run off to be a pirate with his friend joe harper and huckleberry finn even though they have run off so no one could tell them what to do they find themselves feel bad about the thing they have steal they also felt they should still say their prayer even though nobody be there to tell them to that show that even though he have run away to become a pirate he be still good a third example of how tom could be consider a a good person be the time when he save becky in the cave it really be his fault that they get lose in the first place because he lead them far and far in the cave but in the end he save her he leave her and let her sleep and he travel around the cave and eventually he find an entrance out he then go back into the cave to find her then he make his way back with her and they both be able to escape the cave it be brave of tom to go back into the cave for becky a last example of tom act a the kind of character you would admire be the time when tom be go to leave a note for aunt polly say that he be not dead and have only run away but tom do not end up leave the note however he do kiss aunt polly in her sleep before leave this show that even though tom run away he still care about aunt polly and that be good however although tom do show some example of be a likable character he show even more example of be dislikable one example of this be when tom and huck witness injun joe murder dr robinson huck and tom swear not ever to tell anyone about the murder later tom break the vow and confesses in front of everyone but huck never break the vow and in some way tom betray him also if tom and huck have tell earlier but this time agree to both tell muff potter would not have be falsely accuse of murder if muff potter have be prove innocent by tom and huck he would not be in jail for nearly as long a he be if at all another example of tom a a dislikable character be the day he meet the new boy almost the minute tom meet him they be in a fight tom end up win and he beat up the new boy badly that be a pretty mean thing for tom to do especially when it be the new kid another time tom steal a whole leg of a ham he and his friend be play a game and tom take a ham from a family that much ham be a lot of meat and for many family back then that much meat could last the whole winter it be a really terrible thing to do because whoever he steal the meat from might even need it to survive tom should never have steal that meat his friend too have take thing like fish or bacon from other family a third example of tom do something that the reader would think of a a dislikable thing about tom be again the time when tom huck and joe run away tom know that aunt polly be worried sick and very sad but tom and his friend dont even leave a note to their parent or anything to let them know that they be okay that be a very cruel thing to do to them to keep them wait think the boy be dead but the most dislikable thing about tom be the way tom take advantage of his friend one example of this be when tom be give the job of whitewash the fence tom trick his friend into do his chore he make the job seem important by tell his friend that they would not be able to do a good enough job at it they beg him and they trade him

3,"Why I Chose This Animal. I chose horses because I like to ride them. I also like to pet them. At the camp I go to everybody gets to have horses back riding lessons.

Icelandic and Shetland ponies are very small when they are full grown. Chestnuts are red-brown and Roans have white hairs on their brown coat. Cream is a rare color. Rare means you don't see the color cream very much. Brown horses are brown all over. Blacks are black all over. Piebalds have black and white spots. Skewbalds are brown and white. Duns are a sandy brown and black manes and tails. Palominos have a yellowish coat and shiny mane and tail. Grays have black and white hairs that make the color gray.

3,"One night when the air was warm, my puppies were sleeping on the back porch. Me and my sisters were getting ready for bed. When I was in bed. I read a chapter from my Nancy Drew book.

""Just for a drive"" she replied. She had a worried expression on her face. I knew something was wrong. I thought maybe if I went outside and played with my puppies.

I went to my room and cried. Thats all I rembered about that night because I fell asleep. The next day I still worried. I worried all through school. When I got home from me and my mom made a snack for sisters. I asked mom, ""so were are the puppys""? Her eyes started to fill with tears as she answered my question with 3 words,""I don't know,"" she burst into tears. So did I. She hugged me.

4,"Dear Mr. ___________ and Mrs. ___________, We have a problem. The wildlife here in __________ is very limited. There is not a lot of opportunity to learn about conservation and wildlife preservation. If we took a field trip to __________ our problem would be solved. __________, __________, __________ and I would like to take our class for a great learning experience. In addition, we will provide a study guide to __________ to identify the animals and provide information about conservation of endangered wildlife. If we went on a field trip, we will learn about the wildlife from around the world and how __________ provides a natural habitat for them to live and breed. This information would help us to understand the importance of science in our day to day life. We would use math to make a budget and figure out a way to earn money. These skills will be very useful again and again. We will learn how to make a schedule with target dates. This will provide us with a plan that covers the entire project from start to finish. The preparation of the study guide will require lots of research and organization of information. The first thing to do is research, research, research! Next, we will choose a fund raiser (with your approval, of course). This will earn money for the field trip. The parents will hopefully chip in their time and money, if we don’t get enough. We will prepare a plan schedule. This will provide the dates that team members will need to accomplish the steps toward our goal. My competent adult model is the Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World. It shows us step by step how to plan a trip and what to see. Now, you are asking why should I approve a trip to __________? How does this help __________ and the students? Besides the fact that the project planning, fund raising, budgeting and reporting will provide an excellent learning opportunity, it will provide education. It will also provide awareness of wildlife and the importance of conservation. This project will be evaluated by its successful planning and its ability to involve our class in wildlife conservation. The trip will be evaluated by the student participation on the trip and a plan of conservation that identifies what we can all do to protect and respect wildlife so they will still be around when we have children.

4,"One quiet, Tuesday morning, I woke up to a pair of bright, dazzling shoes, lying right in front
of my bedroom door. The shoes were a nice shade of violet and smelled like catnip. I found that out
because my cats, Tigger and Max, were rubbing on my legs, which tickled.
When I started out the door, I noticed that Tigger and Max were following me to school. Other
cats joined in as well. They didn’t even stop when we reached Main Street!
“Don’t you guys have somewhere to be?” I quizzed the cats.
“Meeeeeooooow!” the crowd of cats replied.
As I walked on, I observed many more cats joining the stalking crowd. I moved more swiftly. The
crowd of cats’ walk turned into a prance. I sped up. I felt like a rollercoaster zooming past the crowded
line that was waiting for their turn as I darted down the sidewalk with dashing cats on my tail.
When I reached the school building . . . SLAM! WHACK! “Meeyow!” The door closed and every
single cat flew and hit the door.
Whew! Glad that’s over! I thought.
I walked upstairs and took my seat in the classroom.
“Mrs. Miller! Something smells like catnip! Could you open the windows so the smell will go
away? Pleeeeaase?” Zane whined.
“Oh, sure! We could all use some fresh air right now during class!” Mrs. Miller thoughtfully
responded.
“Nooooooo!” I screamed.
When the teacher opened the windows, the cats pounced into the building.
“It’s a cat attack!” Meisha screamed
Everyone scrambled on top of their desks. Well, everyone except Cade, who was absolutely
obsessed with cats.
“Awww! Look at all the fuzzy kitties! They’re sooo cute! Mrs. Miller, can I pet them?” Cade asked,
adorably.
“Why not! Pet whichever one you want!” she answered.
“Thanks! Okay, kitties, which one of you wants to be petted by Cade Dahlin?” he asked the cats.
None of them answered. They were all staring at me.
“Uh, hi?” I stammered.
Rrriiiiinng! The recess bell rang. Everyone, including Mrs. Miller, darted out the door.
Out at recess, Lissa and I played on the swings.
“Hey! Look over there!” Lissa shouted. Formed as an ocean wave, the cats ran toward me.Luckily, Zane’s cat, Buddy, was prancing along with the aroma of catnip surrounding his fur. He
ran up to me and rubbed on my legs. The shoes fell off. Why didn’t I think of this before? I notioned.
“Hey Cade! Catch!”
Cade grabbed the shoes and slipped them on.
The cats changed directions and headed for Cade.
“I’m in heaven!” he shrieked.",one quiet tuesday morning i wake up to a pair of bright dazzling shoe lie right in front of my bedroom door the shoe be a nice shade of violet and smell like catnip i find that out because my cat tigger and max be rub on my leg which tickle when i start out the door i notice that tigger and max be follow me to school other cat join in as well they didn t even stop when we reach main street don t you guy have somewhere to be i quiz the cat meeeeeooooow the crowd of cat reply a i walk on i observe many more cat join the stalk crowd i move more swiftly the crowd of cat walk turn into a prance i speed up i felt like a rollercoaster zoom past the crowded line that be wait for their turn a i dart down the sidewalk with dash cat on my tail when i reach the school build slam whack meeyow the door close and every single cat fly and hit the door whew glad that s over i think i walk upstairs and take my seat in the classroom mr miller something smell like catnip could you open the window so the smell will go away pleeeeaase zane whine oh sure we could all use some fresh air right now during class mr miller thoughtfully respond nooooooo i scream when the teacher open the window the cat pounce into the building it s a cat attack meisha scream everyone scramble on top of their desk well everyone except cade who be absolutely obsess with cat awww look at all the fuzzy kitty they re sooo cute mr miller can i pet them cade ask adorably why not pet whichever one you want she answer thanks okay kitty which one of you want to be pet by cade dahlin he ask the cat none of them answer they be all staring at me uh hi i stammer rrriiiiinng the recess bell ring everyone include mrs miller dart out the door out at recess lissa and i play on the swing hey look over there lissa shout form a an ocean wave the cat run toward me luckily zane s cat buddy be prance along with the aroma of catnip surround his fur he run up to me and rub on my leg the shoe fell off why didn t i think of this before i notioned hey cade catch cade grab the shoe and slip them on the cat change direction and head for cade i m in heaven he shriek,"+ one quiet , + tuesday morning , I woke up to a pair of bright , dazzling shoes , lying right in front

5,"Roald Dahl is a very interesting author to me. That's because he knows what a kid wants to hear. He has a ""kid's mind"". He is the only author that I know that makes up interesting words like Inkland, fizz wizard, and gobble funking. All his stories are the same type. I don't mean the same story written again and again. What I mean is that they all have imagination, made up words, and disgusting thoughts. Some of his stories that have those things are Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, The Witches and Danny the Champion of the World. The Witches is the book that I am reading right now, and it is like The BFG, another book that is by Roald Dahl. They are alike because in The BFG, Sophie and the BFG, (the big friendly giant), are trying to stop other giants from eating human beings. The Witches has the same problem. The Boy, (he has no name), is trying to stop the witches from turning children into small mice, and then killing the mice by stepping on them. Both stories have to stop evil people from doing something horrible. Roald Dahl uses a lof of similies. Some similies that he used that I like are: Up he shot again like a bullet in the barrel of a gun. And my favorite is: They were like a chorus of dentist' drills grinding away together. In all of Roald Dahl's books, I have noticed that the plot or the main problem of the story is either someone killing someone else, or a kid having a bad life. But it is always about something terrible. All the characters that Roald Dahl ever made were probably fake characters. A few things that the main characters have in common are that they all are poor. None of them are rich. Another thing that they all have in common is that they either have to save the world, someone else, or themselves.",roald dahl be a very interesting author to me that s because he know what a kid want to hear he have a kid s mind he be the only author that i know that make up interesting word like inkland fizz wizard and gobble funk all his story be the same type i don t mean the same story write again and again what i mean be that they all have imagination make up word and disgust thought some of his story that have those thing be charlie and the chocolate factory matilda the witch and danny the champion of the world the witch be the book that i be read right now and it be like the bfg another book that be by roald dahl they be alike because in the bfg sophie and the bfg the big friendly giant be try to stop other giant from eat human being the witch have the same problem the boy he have no name be try to stop the witch from turn child into small mouse and then kill the mouse by step on them both story have to stop evil people from do something horrible roald dahl use a lof of similies some similies that he use that i like be up he shot again like a bullet in the barrel of a gun and my favorite be they be like a chorus of dentist drill grind away together in all of roald dahl s book i have notice that the plot or the main problem of the story be either someone kill someone else or a kid have a bad life but it be always about something terrible all the character that roald dahl ever make be probably fake character a few thing that the main character have in common be that they all be poor none of them be rich another thing that they all have in common be that they either have to save the world someone else or themselves,"+ roald + dahl is a very interesting author to me . + that ' s because he knows what a kid wants to hear . + he has a "" kid ' s mind "" . + he is the only author that I know that makes up interesting words like + inkland , fizz wizard , and gobble funking . + all his stories are the same type .

6,"Dear Mr. Sandler, Did you know that every cigarette a person smokes takes seven minutes off their life? I mentioned this because I just watched the movie, Benchwarmers, and I noticed that Carlos smoked. Why did you feel the need to have one of the characters smoke? Did you think that would make him look cool? Did you think that would make him look older? It did neither of those things. As a matter of fact, I think it made him look stupid and not very cool. Especially when he put out a cigarette on his tongue. If I were producing a movie, I would want my characters to be strong, healthy and smart. I would not have any smokers in my movies for many reasons. The first reason is it sets a bad example for children. An estimated 450,000 Americans die each year from tobacco related disease. In fact, tobacco use causes many different types of cancers such as lung, throat, mouth, and tongue. Another reason not to promote smoking is it ages and wrinkles your skin. Who wants to look 75 if you are only 60? It turns your teeth yellow and may lead to gum disease and tooth decay. Lastly, smoking is a very expensive habit. A heavy smoker spends thousands of dollars a year on cigarettes. I can think of better things to spend money on. So Mr. Sandler, I urge you to take smoking out of all future movies you produce. Instead of having your characters smoke have them do healthy things. That will set a positive influence for children instead of poisoning their minds. Thanks for reading my letter. I hope you agree with my opinion. Sincerely, __________ P.S.

6,"People get pets so that they will never be lonely, and they will always have a friend to be there for them. Ask your heart, what makes the best pet??? Some people think a best pet is picky, energetic, and sneaky, but I think my pet is the best pet because he is a cuddle bug, he’s playful, and he loves me! Gus was about eight weeks old when we got him, now he is 4 1/2 months old, and he is about as big as a size eight sneaker. He is a little gray and white kitten. If you look closely he has a gray tail, but there are darker gray rings around it. He has a little white on his face, and some on his tummy and paws. He has a little stripe on his leg but it is his back left leg only. He’s very cute, and he purrs a lot! He also has a cute little gray nose. One of the reasons why my cat Gus is the best pet is because he is a cuddle bug. When Gus was a baby, he had to be kept in a cage because he wasn’t allowed to interact with the other pets until he was older. He couldn’t interact with the other pets because when Twister was a baby, the ferrets bit her ear and dragged her under the bed, and bit her in the back of the neck and we didn’t want the same thing to happen to Gus. Also because Twister had to be kept in a cage when she was little, too. His cage was in my room so when he meowed, as if to say, “Get me out!” I would have to take him out and sleep with him. All he would do is thank me for doing that by snuggling against my chin! Another example to prove that Gus is a cuddle bug, is that when I’m feeding Gus, I put his and Twister’s bowl up on the counter when I do so, and Twister sits there patiently while Gus is snuggling against my legs to show affection toward me. He snuggles my leg even when I’m walking around! Well, at least he tries to, because he follows me, and when I stop walking, he starts to cuddle. Eventually I pick him up and cuddle him back!!! Finally, when I have nothing to do and I’m just sitting on my bed reading, Gus jumps up with me and then he pushes away the covers to get under them, and he sleeps on my chest to keep my company when I’m board. After he slept on my tummy many times, he finally got the nickname __________ Cuddle Buddy. Now I always snuggle with my favorite cuddle buddy . . . Gus!!! A second reason why Gus is the best pet is because he’s playful. Most of the time when Gus is lying on the couch minding his own business, I’ll reach out to pet him then he’ll start biting my hand and attacking it!!! He does this to be playful, not to hurt anyone but he just wants to have fun. It kind of tickles when he does it, actually. Gus also has a little toy mouse that is attached to a string that I drag around the house so that Gus will follow it. The mouse has a leopard skin pattern on it with balls of fur as hands and feet. The mouse is about the size of the pencil sharpeners in Mrs. __________ classroom. He goes after that mouse so fast that it’s hard to see him running by to catch it. When Gus was a baby, I would put him in my bed to sleep with, but before we went to sleep, I would move my feet around underneath the covers, while Gus was on top chasing them around. Eventually, he got tired and lied down near my feet, but before he was completely asleep, I would pick him up and put him near my pillow and we slept together. Gus loves doing that all the time. I love how Gus is so playful!!! The last reason why Gus is the best pet is because he loves me! He always misses me whenever I’m not there. When I come home from school and I open the door, Gus comes flying around the corner, and starts to climb my pants! When he gets high enough. I grab him in my arms and we start cuddling each other while Gus is happily purring. He does this a lot. Most of the time I’m in my room watching TV, while Gus and Twister are fighting and killing each other, they come dashing around the corner and into my room. I, of course, have to break up the fight. After that, I put them on my bed and hold them down, but they keep squirming. Soon, they get tired and sleep with me, silently, watching TV. Gus is with me as much as possible. Sometimes he’s busy playing with Twister, sleeping, or eating. Otherwise, he’s playing or sleeping with me. We do so many things together and I’m glad I got him, but technically, he chose me. It was a homeless cat shelter. They were able to catch the kittens, but not there mommy. His brothers and sisters were all playing, but he was sleeping under the table. Soon, he walked out from under the table and slept with me while we cuddled on the couch. That’s how I met Gus. People have feelings for their pets that show that they love them very much. When I had to decide what makes the best pet, I would say that Gus is the best pet because he is a cuddle bug, he’s playful, and he loves me. When you think about the examples that I gave you, like when I told you about how Gus snuggles against my chin, you saw that Gus IS the best pet and if you don’t believe me, you have a problem with deciding who the best pet is.",people get pet so that they will never be lonely and they will always have a friend to be there for them ask your heart what make the best pet some people think a best

7,"You are seated in class as your teacher explains and points things out on the whiteboard. You twitch your hand, accidentally nudging your pencil, which rolls off your desk and clatters to the floor. As you lean over to pick up your pencil, your cell phone falls out of your coat pocket! Luckily you catch it without your teacher seeing, but it is in plain view of the video camera’s shiny lens that points straight at you. The classroom phone rings, and after a brief conversation, your teacher walks over to your desk and kneels down beside you. “About that cell phone of yours . . .” How did that get you in trouble? How could it possibly be a good idea to put cameras in classrooms? When students are in their classrooms, teachers are in the classroom too, usually. But when a teacher goes out of the classroom, what usually happens is either everything goes on as usual, or the students get a little more talkative. Cameras aren’t there because people talk a lot. It is the teacher’s job to keep people quiet. If something horrible happened, somebody in class would usually report it, or it would just be obvious to the teacher when he came back that something had happened. If we already have cameras in the halls, why spend the money to get thirty more cameras for all the different classrooms? Our school district already has a low budget, so we would be spending money on something completely unnecessary. There hasn’t been camera-worthy trouble in classrooms. Cameraworthy trouble would be bad behavior every time a teacher left the room. There is no reason to install cameras that might just cause trouble, both for the students and for the budget. Different students react differently when there is a camera in the room. Some students get nervous and flustered, trying hard to stay focused on their work with a camera focused on them. 90% of students claim that they do better work when they are calmer, and cameras are not going to help. Other students look at cameras as a source of entertainment. These students will do things such as wave at the camera, make faces, or say hi to the people watching through the camera. This could be a big distraction for others who are trying to learn and participate in class. Still other students will try to trick the camera. They will find a way to block the lens or do something that the camera will not be likely to catch. All of these different students will be distracted by the cameras in their classrooms. Instead of solving problems, cameras would cause the problems. That is why I disagree with the idea to put cameras in classrooms.

7,"My report is on a very rare and unique wetland that many people do not even know exists. They occur only in a few places around the world. My topic is created by a specific geographical condition. Vernal pools in San Diego occur only on the local mesas and terraces, where soil conditions allow, but these are the ideal place for much of the city’s urban and agricultural development. Is it possible to find a balance between the two conflicting purposes of expansion and preservation? This raises an interesting question; how can you establish vernal pools being thought of as a geographical asset? METHODS To answer my question I had to get information on vernal pools: what they are, where they are, and how they are a sensitive natural habitat. Then I needed to examine how city expansion is affecting vernal pools, and if it is apt to continue. I needed to know what the City thinks about the problem and what they are planning to do. First I looked for any information available on vernal pools at public libraries, but I couldn’t find what I was looking for. The topic is apparently too obscure. Next I went to a university library that had an environmental department to get as much information as possible (University of San Diego). I also interviewed several authorities in the field: the district representative for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the federal agency responsible for the protection of wetlands; a senior environment planner with the City of San Diego, who wrote the City’s Resource Protection Ordinance (RPO); the Station botanist at Miramar Naval Air Station, who is in charge of their vernal pool management plan on the land that has the largest number of pools remaining in the City of San Diego; a biologist working for RECON (Regional Environmental Consultants), a firm which is mapping the vernal pools for the City of Hemet, (another city in San Diego County facing the same issues); and finally a geographer working for SANDAG (San Diego Association of Governments), a regional organization that gathers, records, and analyzes data associated with regional planning and environmental issues. They answered many questions and offered their own ideas and information, including additional articles on my subject. I looked at several maps and photos of vernal pools locations, and charts of changing land use. To decide how much education may be needed about vernal pools, I made a questionnaire, and surveyed two classrooms of elementary students, and a group of forty-two adults, trying to cover most age groups. WHAT VERNAL POOLS ARE Vernal pools are a unique and rare form of wetland. Wetlands are areas that are covered or soaked by water enough to support plants that grow only in moist ground. Some examples of wetlands are bogs, swamps, marshes, and edges of lakes and streams. These are what people think of when they hear “wetland”. But vernal pools are different than these other types of wetlands. They are located on dry and flat places. No one would expect to find a wetland in such a dry area! San Diego vernal pools are surrounded by small mounds called “mima mounds”. The name mima mounds come from the Mima Prairie near Olympia, Washington. People don’t know for sure how mima mounds are formed. Some think that they were formed by gophers piling up the earth. Others think that ice wedges from glaciers caused the upheaval, or maybe the wind pushed loose dirt, catching in clumps of shrubs. Mounds can be found on prairies or terraces with a hardpan or clay layer underneath. Vernal pools are depressions between the mima mounds. In winter the pools are filled by rain
storms. In spring the pools look their best, when plants are in full splendor. By summer the pools are
dry and look only like a dry pothole, (See illustration of pool cycles and typical cross section.) A vernal
pool does not dry by soaking into the ground; the layer of clay or rock underneath the pool prevents
the water from soaking through. Instead they dry out from evaporation, or use by the plants. The mima
mounds are not impervious so one pool tends to drain into another. Therefore, the pools have to be on
flat land; the pools cannot be on a slope or the water would run off, and the pools would not be filled.

Vernal Pool Cycle
WHY VERNAL POOLS ARE SO IMPORTANT
Vernal pools are a very rare, specific habitat. Hardly any are left, so we don’t have many to lose.
There used to be vernal pools on many of the mesas and terraces of San Diego County, and the Central
Valley of California. Now there are almost no vernal pools in the Central Valley, and an estimated 97%
have been lost in San Diego County. An estimated 80% of the remaining pools in San Diego are located
on Miramar Naval Air Station. (See map, next page.)

Vernal Pool Distribution, San Diego County
It does not take much to disturb a vernal pool. Even grazing or off road vehicle use in the
summer, when pool species are dormant and people could think they are just a dry hole, can damage
them. Most are disturbed by grading and flattening of their habitat, or by breakup of the impervious
layer. With just flat land there would be no depressions for vernal pools to form; what would form would
be “vernal mud”. With no impervious layer the water would just sink into the ground, and would be there
only for a short period of time, not enough for wetland plants.
The mima mounds have to be protected too. If the watershed for the pools is changed, the
condition of the pools changes. If there isn’t enough water from runoff, then all plant or animal life in
them disappears, because they need enough moisture at the right time, to live. If there is too much
water, then the pool may turn into another kind of wetland, such as a bog.
Although people have begun to study them, there is still a lot to learn. One thing scientists know
is that they are a part of a larger environment. Many animals travel from other areas to feed on plants or
animals, or drink from the vernal pools. For example, water fowl from many other places will stop at the
pools to eat the fairy shrimp and snack on the plants.
Vernal pools have a large assortment of rare and exotic flora and fauna (plants and animals).
Five of them are on the federal list of endangered species, and one more is a candidate for listing. The
plants and animals in vernal pools are unusual because they have only developed recently compared to
other changes in evolution. As scientists study the pools more intently they are finding more and more
unknown species. There are temporary pools in other places around the world, but California’s vernal
pools are different because of their long drought phase, which causes the plants and animals to adapt to
the climate. They go into a dormant phase. For example, fairy shrimp lay eggs before the drought which
hatch when it gets moist enough to be active. Some plants, in a short period of time, develop seeds;
others appear to die out, but quickly spout again from the rain. Many of these species cannot survive
outside vernal pools, and some are “endemic” (species found only in a very restricted geographical area).
PROTECTION TECHNIQUES
The first step is to try to keep development away from vernal pools. But to do this you first need
to know where the pools are. Thanks to regional mapping efforts, existing vernal pools have been fairly
well identified in San Diego County. There are already laws against disturbances of vernal pools. You could go to jail or get fined
a large sum of money for disturbing a wetland. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service protects the listed
endangered species present, and the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers makes sure you don’t fill any kind
of wetland habitat, including vernal pools. The local office of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has
submitted a proposal to Washington for a stricter permit process for vernal pools.
When possible the vernal pools should be part of a large preserve of open space. That way
the pools would not be isolated islands, but part of their natural communities, and would be protected
by a buffer of distance. Fences should not be put directly around the vernal pools unless it cannot be
avoided, because it would keep some animals out, such as rabbits which spread plant seeds around
when they eat them.
It is important to educate people about vernal pools so they know how important they are
and what they look like, and so they know how to preserve them. To see how much education may be
needed in San Diego, I surveyed ninety-two people (forty-two adults and fifty elementary students to try
to cover all age groups). I asked them if they had heard of vernal pools, and if they knew what they were.
About 21% thought they had heard of them, but only 7% really knew what they were. (See pie chart.) I
found that much education is needed.

Survey Results
At N.A.S. Miramar the Station botanist has been putting articles dealing with vernal pools in
almost every issue of the base newspaper. Now most people on the base know about vernal pools, and
know how valuable they are.
RECOGNIZING AN ASSET
Education is a key to preserving vernal pools. Vernal pools are very unique and we do not
have many to lose. Making new ones does not work. Studies done at the University of California, Santa
Barbara, have shown that after five years their complexity goes down.
First, vernal pools must be protected. There could be different ranges of accessibility, from
remote (available to research only), somewhat accessible (good for guided seasonal visits), to readily
accessible (which may have to be protected by fencing or supervision). The most accessible ones would
be a great educational opportunity for the general public. The pools closer to development could be
developed into nature centers, with raised boardwalks to protect the habitat, as is done over the hot
springs in Yellowstone. (See illustration.)
[Illustration here]
Cross Section of Possible Nature Center
Interpretive signs and docents could provide information. Being very unique, vernal pools would
make interesting learning centers. People would learn how the plants and animals adapt to the seasonal
changes. This would teach people the importance of vernal pools, how complex they are, how to identify
them, and how to preserve them when wet or dry. A park in the Sacramento area has an adjacent
vernal pool with hiking trails around it; and it seems to work there because the people there know how
important and delicate it is.
Ecotourism, a popular concept now, would be another idea. San Diego is a place where tourists
already come. The very climate and geography that brings people here is what created vernal pools.
Ecotourism would be easy to add to the other attractions, and would indirectly benefit the city. A tour
company might be authorized to place advertisements to bring people to learn the importance of
vernal pools and their ecosystem. With many people outside San Diego knowing about vernal pools and
concerned about their well-being, there would be widespread support for vernal pool protection. CONCLUSION
The problem of endangering vernal pools will not go away, because the City will need more
land to develop. However, vernal pools remain a rare and unique wetland, and need protection. Even
though there are laws made to protect them, pools are still being lost. Education is needed. Widespread
education showing how important vernal pools are, and how easy they are to disturb, will create
widespread support for protection.
A balance between expansion and preservation will not come easily, but if the public views
vernal pools as a geographical asset, the balance will shift toward long-term vernal pool preservation.

8,"What I like doing best is playing football, mainly because it is one of my best sports. One of the greatest things about it, in my opinion, is the anticipation, wondering what the other players are thinking about what you might do. Football is a physical game, of course, but it’s the mental aspect that I appreciate the most. At times football can get grueling, which makes the game even more exciting. The first time you make contact with another player (even with all that equipment) you get very sore. That is true for everyone, but in time you get used to the aches and pains. After awhile, you develop mental discipline, which allows you to ignore some of the pain. The mental discipline then allows you to go all out, to unload everything you have, every play. That’s how you win games, everyone going all out, giving 110%. The game takes concentration, just as much as any other sport, if not more. You develop this aspect in practice. That is why it is so important to have hours and hours of it. Mentally, you have to get over the fear, the fear of eleven madmen waiting for chance to make you eat dirt. And that comes through practice. Once you overcome the fear, you can concentrate on the more important things, like anticipating the other guy’s next move. Studying the playbook and talking with other players also helps. During the game, your mind clears of all thoughts. These thoughts become instinct. You have to react, and react quickly, and you develop reactions and instinct in practice. For example, when you’re carrying the ball or about to make a tackle, you want to make sure you have more momentum than the other guy. If you don’t you’ll be leveled. But, you should react instinctively to that situation by increasing your momentum. Playing defense, all you want to do is hit the man with the ball, hit him hard. Right when you unload for a stick, all your body tightens. Then you feel the impact. After you regain your thoughts, you wonder if you’re all right. You wait for your brain to get the pain signal from the nerves. Even so, if you do get that signal, which is always the case, you keep right on playing. You can’t let that experience shake your concentration. On offense, while playing receiver, you can actually “hear” the footsteps of the defensive back as you’re concentrating on catching the ball. What separates the men from the boys is the one who “hears” the footsteps but doesn’t miss the ball. That’s mental discipline, concentration. Football is very physical or else it wouldn’t be fun. But it is also a mental game and that is why it’s challenging. You can get hurt in football if you screw up and ignore the right way to do things. However, mental discipline and concentration, which you develop during hours of practice, helps you avoid such mistakes.",what i like do best be play football mainly because it be one of my best sport

8,"In the book The Old Man and the Sea, Ernest Hemingway tells the story of an old Cuban fisherman named Santiago who, considered by the villagers to be the worst type of unlucky, is still determined to win a battle against a giant Marlin off the coast of Cuba. Santiago succeeds, but his successes do not come without great hardship and struggle. He spends three days being dragged in his skiff by the enormous marlin with minimal food and water, all the while enduring acute physical pain, tiredness, and an unending loneliness due to the absence of his young friend, Manolin. It is only after Santiago’s prize fish is completely devoured by sharks that he returns home to the village scorners and the safety of Manolin’s trust. As his suffering and loss compound, we can see that Hemingway’s quote “a man can be destroyed but not defeated” offers a key insight into Santiago’s life. As the story begins, we learn that Santiago has gone eighty-four days straight without catching a fish. Young Manolin’s parents will no longer allow the two to fish together, for they do not want their son being exposed any more to this type of failure. Santiago and Manolin are deeply saddened by this news, but Santiago does not let the loss of his friend or the defeat that others see him suffering keep him off the sea. Rather, with bright and shining eyes he thinks “maybe today. Every day is a new day” (pg. 32), and prepares to catch the biggest fish of his life. This shows that even though almost all of Santiago’s acquaintances feel that his fishing career is over, he sees it about to reach its all time high. Though he knows he is physically older and weaker than most of his fellow fisherman, he refuses to let their opinions and stereotypes destroy his confidence and determination. As the story progresses, Hemingway presents an even more vivid picture of Santiago refusing to be destroyed by the forces that threaten to defeat him. Even after he accomplishes the difficult task of hooking the giant Marlin, he finds his skiff being dragged by the fish for over two days. Living in the small boat is no easy task for Santiago, and soon injury and suffering seem to take over his entire body. His back is sore from sitting so long against the stiff wood, his face is cut from fishing hooks, his shoulders ache, and his eyes have trouble focusing. Most difficult to endure though is the terrible condition in which he finds his hands. The left one is weakened from a period of being tightly cramped, and both are extremely mutilated from the burn of the moving fishing line. It would have been so much easier for Santiago to simply give up and release the fish, yet he knows that if he endures a little longer, victory will be his. Even when it seems he has no effort left, Santiago promises himself “I’ll try it again.” (pg. 93) This is Santiago’s real inner determination coming through. He has encountered so many obstacles during the past few days, yet he will not let them defeat his dream of killing the fish. There is no outside force promising a splendid reward if he succeeds, only those that threaten to ridicule him if he is destroyed. Santiago is working solely on his own desire to fulfill his dream and prove to himself that, although his struggles may cost him his life, he can accomplish even the seemingly impossible. After three long days and nights, Santiago’s determination pays off, and at last he manages to catch and kill the Marlin. It is only a very short time that he has to relish in his triumph though, for a few hours later vicious sharks begin to destroy the carcass of the great fish. For hours, Santiago manages to ward them off, but this time it is not he who wins the final battle. Spirits low and pain at an all time high, Santiago returns to the village, towing behind him only the bare skeleton of a treasure that once was. It seems as though Santiago is ready to just curl up and die, and indeed he has reason to feel this way. Yet as he rests alone and talk with Manolin, we see a hint of Santiago’s determination, that has characterized his personality throughout the entire story, begin to shine through. Upon reaching home, he begins to make plans with Manolin about future adventures they will have together. Hemingway tells us that Santiago, in his youth, had loved to watch the majestic lions along his home on a white sand beach in Africa, and he still returns to those dreams when searching for contentment. That night, as Santiago drifts off to sleep, Hemingway tells that he was indeed “dreaming about the lions.” (pg. 127) This is perhaps the truest test of how much courage and determination a person has. If even when they have suffered the biggest defeat of their life, they are able to look to the future and realize the wonderful things they still posses. Though the forces of nature and time destroyed Santiago’s prize fish, he refuses to let that fact ruin the rest of his life. No one can take away his love for Manolin or memories of what once was, and because of this, no one can ever truly defeat Santiago. In conclusion, throughout the entire story The Old Man and the Sea, Santiago refuses to
surrender to the forces working against him. He ignores the comments of those who think he is
unlucky, endures great physical pain, and rises up from the depths of sorrow over the lost Marlin to find
happiness in what he does possess. Hemingway’s quote “a man can be destroyed but not defeated” truly
does display the amount of determination that Santiago shows throughout his life.",in the book the old man and the sea ernest hemingway tell the story of an old cuban fisherman name santiago who

9,"John Boyne’s story, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, tells the tale of an incredible friendship between two eight-year old boys during the Holocaust. One of the boys is Bruno, the son of an important German commander who is put in charge of Auschwitz Camp, and the other is Shmuel, a Jewish boy inside the camp. Throughout the story their forbidden friendship grows, and the two boys unknowingly break the incredible racial boundaries of the time. They remain best friends until Bruno goes under the fence to help Shmuel find his father when they are both killed in the gas showers of the camp. By comparing and contrasting supporting characters, irony, and the themes in the movie and the book, it is clear that the movie, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas (Mark Herman, 2008) is not nearly as good as the novel of the same title. Characterization is very important to a story and influences how a person interprets the novel or movie, and one important way that the book differs from the movie is how Bruno’s mother is characterized. In the movie, she is unrealistically portrayed as an honest woman with good moral values, and is almost as naive as Bruno is about what is going on at Auschwitz. When she discovers what her husband is doing to people at the camp she is deeply disturbed. Mortified by her husband’s cruelty, their relationship declines. In contrast, she is a far more sinister character in the book. Though Bruno is too young to understand what his mother is doing, one of the reasons he dislikes Lieutenant Kotler is that, “ . . . he was always in the living room with Mother and making jokes with her, and Mother laughed at his jokes more than she laughed at Father’s” (162). Bruno’s mother is very unhappy in her new situation away from Berlin, and her discontent leads her to cheat on her husband. This also leads her to unknowingly hurt her son, for Bruno is upset that she is paying more attention to Lieutenant Kotler than she is to his father, and the damage she causes could be magnified if she continues to disrupt their family. Further examples of her abysmal character and unfaithfulness are revealed when Bruno’s mother finds the young lieutenant and says, “Oh Kurt, precious, you’re still here . . . I have a little free time now if—Oh! she said, noticing Bruno standing there. ‘Bruno! What are you doing here?’”(166). Her disloyalty further allows the reader to see that her character is far from virtuous, contrary to the opinion of a person who viewed the movie. Throughout the story, it also becomes apparent that Bruno’s mother is also an alcoholic, and, “Bruno worried for her health because he’d never known anyone to need quite so many medicinal sherries” (188). Unable to come to terms with her new circumstances and strained relationship with her husband, Bruno’s mother tries to drink away her problems, further conveying that she is a weak character. Bruno’s extreme innocence about his mother and situation at Auschwitz are magnified by the use of irony in both the movie and the book. In some ways the book and the movie have similar aspects, and one of these aspects is how irony is used to emphasize Bruno’s innocence and to greatly emphasize the tragic mood of the story. In the final climactic scene of the movie—just after Bruno has gone under the fence to help Shmuel find his father— the two boys are led to the gas showers to be killed. Unaware of what is about to happen to them, Bruno tells Shmuel that his father must have ordered this so it must be for a good reason, and that they are going into the air-tight rooms to stay out of the rain and avoid getting sick. This statement is incredibly ironic because, unbeknownst to Bruno, his father has unknowingly commenced his own son’s death sentence. In addition to this, the soldiers have no intention of keeping their prisoners healthy. It never occurs to Bruno that anyone would want to destroy another human being or treat them badly, and his innocence makes his premature death all the more tragic. Although the movie may be incredibly ironic in a few specific instances, the book contains a plethora of ironic events that also accentuate Bruno’s childishness and naivety. A profound example of this is exhibited when Bruno thinks to himself that, “ . . . he did like stripes and he felt increasingly fed up that he had to wear trousers and shirts and ties and shoes that were too tight for him when Shmuel and his friends got to wear striped pajamas all day long” (155). Bruno has no clue that the people in the “striped pajamas” are being cruelly treated and murdered, and is jealous of what he thinks is freedom. Bruno once again reveals his innocence when he asks Pavel, the Jewish man from the camp who cleans him up after a fall, “If you’re a doctor, then why are you waiting on tables? Why aren’t you working at a hospital somewhere?” (83). It is a mystery to Bruno that a doctor would be reduced to such a state for no transparent reason, and his beliefs should be what all adults think. Though what he says is naive, it points out the barbarity of the German attitude toward the Jews. If an uneducated
child could be puzzled by this, then how could learned adults allow such a thing? Through Bruno’s
comment, John Boyne conveys the corruptness of the German leaders during the Holocaust, an idea that
the movie does not relay to the watcher nearly as well. The book impels the reader to think deeper about
the horrors of the Holocaust, and all this ties into the true theme of the story.
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas and its movie counterpart both have different themes, but it is the book’s
theme that accurately states the author’s message. The movie ends with a race against time as Bruno’s
family searches for him in the camp, trying to find him before he is killed. They are too late, and Bruno
and Shmuel die together like so many other anonymous children during the Holocaust. The theme of the
movie is how so many children died at the ruthless hands of their captors; but the book’s theme has a
deeper meaning. As Bruno and Shmuel die together in the chamber, “ . . . the room went very dark, and
in the chaos that followed, Bruno found that he was still holding Shmuel’s hand in his own and nothing
in the world would have persuaded him to let it go” (242). Bruno loves Schmuel, and he is willing to stay
with him no matter what the consequences, even if it means dying with him in the camp that his father
controls. They have conquered all boundaries, and this makes the two boys more than just two more
individuals who died in Auschwitz. The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is not the story of two children who
died in a concentration camp; this story is about an incredible friendship that triumphed over racism
and lasted until the very end. It is the story of what should have been between Jews and Germans, a
friendship between two groups of people in one nation who used their strengths to help each other.
Based on the analysis of supporting characters, irony, and themes of John Boyne’s The Boy in the Striped
Pajamas and the movie, it can be concluded that the book is far superior to the movie. Though Bruno’s
mother is a dishonest woman in the book, her bad character is more realistic for the time when compared
to the mother in the movie who is horrified by Auschwitz. John Boyne uses many examples of irony in the
book to emphasize Bruno’s innocence and to magnify the tragedy of his death. Unlike the movie the irony
in the book leads the reader to ponder on the barbarity of the German leaders during the Holocaust. The
book’s theme of long lasting friendship gives purpose to the story, while the movie’s theme of the cruelty
of concentration camps does not lead the viewer to delve deeper into the story. It is necessary for the
person to read this book in order to understand the true message of friendship and cooperation in the
story, a message that a person who had only seen the movie could not even begin to grasp.",john boyne s story the boy in the striped pajama tell the tale of an incredible friendship between two eight

about what be go on at auschwitz when she discover what her husband be do to people at the camp she be deeply disturbed mortify by her husband s cruelty their relationship decline in contrast she be a far more sinister character in the book though bruno be too young to understand what his mother be do one of the reason he dislike lieutenant kotler be that he be always in the living room with mother and make joke with her and mother laugh at his joke more than she laugh at father s bruno s mother be very unhappy in her new situation away from berlin and her discontent lead her to cheat on her husband this also lead her to unknowingly hurt her son for bruno be upset that she be pay more attention to lieutenant kotler than she be to his father and the damage she cause could be magnify if she continue to disrupt their family far example of her abysmal character and unfaithfulness be reveal when bruno s mother find the young lieutenant and say oh kurt precious you re still here i have a little free time now if oh she say notice bruno stand there bruno what be you do here her disloyalty far allow the reader to see that her character be far from virtuous contrary to the opinion of a person who view the movie throughout the story it also become apparent that bruno s mother be also an alcoholic and bruno worried for her health because he d never know anyone to need quite so many medicinal sherry unable to come to term with her new circumstance and strain relationship with her husband bruno s mother try to drink away her problem far convey that she be a weak character bruno s extreme innocence about his mother and situation at auschwitz be magnify by the use of irony in both the movie and the book in some way the book and the movie have similar aspect and one of these aspect be how irony be use to emphasize bruno s innocence and to greatly emphasize the tragic mood of the story in the final climactic scene of the movie just after bruno have go under the fence to help shmuel find his father the two boy be lead to the gas shower to be kill unaware of what be about to happen to them bruno tell shmuel that his father must have order this so it must be for a good reason and that they be go into the air tight room to stay out of the rain and avoid get sick this statement be incredibly ironic because unbeknownst to bruno his father have unknowingly commence his own son s death sentence in addition to this the soldier have no intention of keep their prisoner healthy it never occur to bruno that anyone would want to destroy another human be or treat them badly and his innocence make his premature death all the more tragic although the movie may be incredibly ironic in a few specific instance the book contain a plethora of ironic event that also accentuate bruno s childishness and naivety a profound example of this be exhibit when bruno think to himself that he do like stripe and he felt increasingly feed up that he have to wear trouser and shirt and tie and shoe that be too tight for him when shmuel and his friend get to wear striped pajamas all day long bruno have no clue that the people in the striped pajama be be cruelly treat and murder and be jealous of what he think be freedom bruno once again reveal his innocence when he ask pavel the jewish man from the camp who clean him up after a fall if you re a doctor then why be you wait on table why aren t you work at a hospital somewhere it be a mystery to bruno that a doctor would be reduce to such a state for no transparent reason and his belief should be what all adults think though what he say be naive it point out the barbarity of the german attitude toward the jew if an uneducated child could be puzzle by this then how could learn adult allow such a thing through bruno s comment john boyne convey the corruptness of the german leader during the holocaust an idea that the movie do not relay to the watcher nearly as well the book impel the reader to think deep about the horror of the holocaust and all this tie into the true theme of the story the boy in the striped pajama and it movie counterpart both have different theme but it be the book s theme that accurately state the author s message the movie end with a race against time a bruno s family search for him in the camp try to find him before he be kill they be too late and bruno and shmuel die together like so many other anonymous child during the holocaust the theme of the movie be how so many child die at the ruthless hand of their captor but the book s theme have a deep meaning a bruno and shmuel die together in the chamber the room go very dark and in the chaos that follow bruno find that he be still hold shmuel s hand in his own and nothing in the world would have persuade him to let it go bruno love schmuel and he be willing to stay with him no matter what the consequence even if it mean die with him in the camp that his father control they have conquer all boundary and this make the two boy more than just two more individual who die in auschwitz the boy in the striped pajama be not the story of two child who die in a concentration camp this story be about an incredible friendship that triumph over racism and last until the very end it be the story of what should have be between jew and german a friendship between two group of people in one nation who use their strength to help each other base on the analysis of support character irony and theme of john boyne s the boy in the striped pajama and the movie it can be conclude that the book be far superior to the movie though bruno s mother be a dishonest woman in the book her bad character be more realistic for the time when compare to the mother in the movie who be horrify by auschwitz john boyne use many example of irony in the book to emphasize bruno s innocence and to magnify the tragedy of his death unlike the movie the irony in the book lead the reader to ponder on the barbarity of the german leader during the holocaust

9,"More than 8,000 miles of land and sea separate two seemingly contrasting young women. One young girl lives in the urban streets of Chicago, depicted in The House on Mango Street by Sandra Cisneros (1984), while the other thrives in the countryside of New Zealand, as shown in Whale Rider, directed by Niki Caro (2003)—one an immigrant from a foreign country and the other a native Maori descendent. Both girls struggle for change, fighting their own quiet wars. Despite the vast differences in lifestyle and culture, both Esperanza Cordero of Chicago and Paikea Apirana of New Zealand are destined to be leaders of their generation in spite of the multitude of traditions and expectations that define them as individuals and their role as women in society. These two natural-born leaders are bridging the gap between the ancient customs and modern-day life. While culture has a huge impact on the Cordero and Apirana families, the protagonists of both groups are affected the most. In Esperanza’s world, women are put down and locked inside their husband’s houses, having no rights and absolutely no say in their own households. The patriarchal society overwhelms every aspect of life, and Esperanza demands change through rebelling in her own quiet war. “I have decided not to grow up tame like the others who lay their necks on the threshold waiting for the ball and chain” (The House on Mango Street). She plans to set her own example, to forge her own path, in the hopes that the oppressed women of Mango Street will realize alternative options. Desperately seeking an opportunity to flee Mango Street, Esperanza dreams of the day when she will leave just another crippled house to seek her own way in the world. However, she states, “They will not know I have gone away to come back. For the ones I left behind. For the ones who cannot get out” (The House on Mango Street). Paikea, on the other hand is a native of New Zealand. According to legend, her ancestor and namesake rode on the back of a whale to this land and her family has been there ever since. Because of her rich and influential history, Pai is very proud of her culture. She wants the best for her people and she understands that the village and tribe must modernize and change with the times or else they may lose everything. For example, in the movie Whale Rider, Pai walks into her kitchen to find three elder women smoking cigarettes. Hiding the evidence, the conversation dies as soon as she enters the room, but she says to them, “Maori women have got to stop smoking.” Pai loves her culture and the significance of the whale, yet she, like Esperanza, demands change, starting with her grandfather Koro accepting the fact that Pai is destined to become the first female chief of the village. Both girls dream of the day where their women will be respected and treated as equals in their patriarchal societies. Family also plays an important role in both The House on Mango Street and Whale Rider. The Corderos are one happy group, with lots of strong and inspirational individuals, binding relatives together like a ribbon on a present. Esperanza, the namesake and great-grandmother of the young protagonist, was a strong-willed woman. “My great-grandmother. I would’ve liked to have known her, a wild horse of a woman, so wild she wouldn’t marry” (The House on Mango Street). Another prominent man is Esperanza’s Uncle Nacho. At a baptism, Uncle Nacho convinces Esperanza to dance; despite her sad brown shoes, she in fact does with her uncle telling her how beautiful she is, making her forget her discomfort and hatred of her shoes. Even though Esperanza may be loved in her family and close community, she is of low social status in general. She, like Geraldo in the vignette “Geraldo No Last Name,” is “just another brazer who didn’t speak English. Just another wetback. You know the kind. The ones who always look ashamed.” Her father is a gardener at rich people’s houses, and her mother watches over the four children (Esperanza, Nenny, Carlos, and Kiki). From a typical Mexican family, Esperanza is not poor but also has never really experienced any luxury other than a used car. On the other hand, Paikea comes from a broken family. Her mother died during childbirth, along with her twin brother. After feeling the depression of loss and loneliness, Pai’s father Porourangi left New Zealand to live in Germany, where he sculpted and sold Maori art. Pai was left to be raised by her grandparents Koro, the current chief, and Nanny Flowers. Similar to Esperanza, Pai shares common family members that inspired them and encouraged them through their trials, Nanny Flowers, for example, raised Pai to be the woman she is—independent and tough. Regardless of the criticism from Koro, Nanny Flowers encourages Pai to do what she knows is best, even if that results in harsh consequences. For example, during the movie, Pai and the young boys of the village attend a school lesson taught by Koro. Pai is last in line, but sits down on the front bench with the others, although Koro tells her to sit in the back, the proper place for a woman. She refuses to move even when her grandfather threatens to send her away, which he does because Pai will not give up her seat. As she walks away from the group, Nanny Flowers has a proud little smile on her lips, for she knows that Pai is ordained to be the next leader. Because Pai is next in line to become the chief, she is of very high status, just below the current chief. A prominent figure on Mango Street, Esperanza presents an alternative to the oppression of women in the community. In the outside world, however, she is just another young girl with parents who immigrated to the United States in the hopes of a better life for their children. Esperanza wants to set an example for the women trapped in their houses, to provide an escape for those ensnared in the barbed wire of marriage. Above all, she dreams of the day where she can leave Mango Street, yet she knows that it is her duty to return to free her friends. As told by the Three Sisters, “You will always be Esperanza. You will always be Mango Street. You can’t erase what you know. You can’t forget who you are.” These three women told Esperanza that she was special and was meant to be a strong and leading person, just like Pai and the whales. Because of the rich diversity and influences in her neighborhood, Esperanza learns through her friends and experiences they share. Marin, Rafaela, Lucy, Rachel, Sally, and Alicia all provided a learning experience in one way or another. As all of these young ladies are in a similar age range with Esperanza, they undergo multiple trials side-by-side. Contrastingly, Paikea has the blood of a leader running through her veins. She is a native, a leader, and a change. Pai, like Esperanza, is a leading figure amongst the women of her community. Always aware of the outer world, Pai knows that her people must adapt to the changing times or they will be swept away by the current of technology. She holds a great love and respect for her culture and people, and she wants what is best for them, even if it involves changing ancient traditions and ways. Pai knows it is her duty to stay, and her desire keeps her rooted in her little village. Once, Pai’s father offered to take her to Germany with him to start a new life, and she agreed to go with him. However, in the car ride along the beach, a whale calls from the depths of the ocean and it is then that Pai knows she cannot leave her people. She asks her father to turn around and she returns to the village of her people. Due to having little to no interaction with kids her age, Pai must learn from her elders and through Koro’s reactions. The children of the village tease and taunt Pai for her name and her big dreams, yet she pays them no attention. Unlike Esperanza, Pai knew from the beginning that she was destined to be great and is different from others her age. Finally, the personalities of these two protagonists are exceedingly different. Esperanza, although older than Paikea, has low self-esteem and little self-confidence. She is afraid of adults, and as shown in “A Rice Sandwich,” she often cries when confronted by her elders. Throughout the novel, Esperanza is shamed by her actions, other’s actions, and other’s words. All this young girl wants is to make friends and be loved by others, but she gets in her own way. However, when the world seems against her and she is all alone, Esperanza writes to escape. As directed by her deceased Aunt Lupe, she continues the poetry and short stories that free her from the chokehold of Mango Street. While she finds joy in pencils and paper, she does not in her name. “Esperanza” in Spanish means “hope” and “waiting,” two words that describe this girl perfectly. She is the hope for the oppressed but she must wait for her opportunity to leave. In contrast to Pai, she actually did have a childhood, a carefree times of playing and having fun with friends before the burden of responsibility is placed on their shoulders, like the sky on Atlas’s. Paikea, alternatively, is a proud and confident girl. She knows what is best and what her people must do in order to survive. Starting with the women, she tells them to change their ways at the ripe old age of ten. Pai is a serious and mature child, with a grown mannerism and demeanor. Little can shame her, except for her grandfather; all Pail wants is to be loved and accepted by Koro. While everyone in the village can see that Pai is fated to become the next chief, Koro stubbornly refuses to believe until the very end. In her position, she takes her ancestry very seriously. Pai was named after her ancestor who rode the back of a whale to New Zealand, and she is exceedingly proud of her name, unlike Esperanza. And unlike Esperanza, it seems as though Pai has no time for boys or any relationships between them. She considers herself “one of the boys,” and shows no interest. Growing up with her situation and the multiple responsibilities that followed left little time for an actual childhood. In the end, the fate of two different cultures rests in the hands of two different young girls. While they both strive for freedom from oppression and change, Esperanza Cordero and Paikea Apirana have different techniques through which they reach those goals. Esperanza, a quiet and ashamed girl of 13 or 14, chooses a singular path to walk. She chooses the road she must walk alone, unaccompanied but free from patriarchal domination. While fighting to free those sitting at the window, Esperanza finds her own destiny as the change needed on Mango Street. Paikea, a strong and confident girl of 10 or 11, walks the forbidden path, the path of a chief. She chooses to defy her grandfather and all traditions in order to modernize her people. In order to save them, she must change them. Both young women, influential and inspiring, search for the key to free the ones they love.",more than mile of land and sea separate two seemingly contrast young woman one young girl life in the urban

9,"Civil disobedience is the refusal to follow an unjust law. Gandhi led India to independence by using civil disobedience and non-violent resistance. His motto was, “will not fight, will not comply.” One of Gandhi’s first acts of civil disobedience was when he refused to move to 3rd class on the train. He bought a 1st class ticket but they wouldn’t let him sit there. He then got kicked off the train. This is just one example of Gandhi’s enforcement of non-violent resistance. He has done many things from refusing to get off the sidewalk to being beaten for burning his pass. He figured that if he died, it would be for the right reasons. He said, “They can have my body, not my obedience.” Eventually he got all of India going against Britain’s unjust laws. While it took the people of India longer to realize, Gandhi proved that civil disobedience and non-violent resistance can be a more effective way of fighting back. Britain finally let India have its independence.",civil disobedience be the refusal to follow an unjust law gandhi lead india to independence by use civil disobedience and non violent resistance his motto be will not fight will not comply one of gandhi s first act of civil disobedience be when he refuse to move to rd class on the train he buy a st class ticket but they wouldn t let him sit there he then get kick off the train this be just one example of gandhi s enforcement of non violent resistance he have do many thing from refuse to get off the sidewalk to be beat for burn his pas he figure that if he die it would be for the right reason he say they can have my body not my obedience eventually he get all of india go against britain s unjust law while it take the people of india long to realize gandhi prove that civil disobedience and non violent resistance can be a more effective way of fight back britain finally let india have it independence,"+ civil disobedience is the refusal to follow an unjust law . + gandhi led + india to independence by using civil disobedience and non - violent resistance . + his motto was , will not fight , will not comply . + one of + gandhi’s first acts of civil disobedience was when he refused to move to 3rd class on the train . + he bought a 1st class ticket but they wouldn’t let him sit there . + he then got kicked off the train . + this is just one example of + gandhi’s enforcement of non - violent resistance . + he has done many things from refusing to get off the sidewalk to being beaten for burning his pass . + he figured that if he died , it would be for the right reasons . + he said , + they can have my body , not my obedience . + eventually he got all of + india going against + britain’s unjust laws . + while it took the people of + india longer to realize , + gandhi proved that civil disobedience and non - violent resistance can be a more effective way of fighting back . + britain finally let + india have its independence .

10,"The __________ School Board has recently proposed a bond levy to add new facilities as well as conduct some major repairs to the school. The bond includes building a new gymnasium, a new science room and lab, a new Media Center/Library, new Chapter 1 and Special Education classrooms, and other facilities such as more parking space, an increase in storage area, and new locker rooms. Along with new construction, the board is proposing to remodel facilities such as the drama/music areas, the entire roof, the heating system, the school kitchen, and present gym as well. This bond allowing __________ School to add more facilities should be passed in order for young students to be provided with a better education. Several arguments have been brought up concerning the levy since it failed in the March election. Some say that the school doesn’t need to have brand new facilities and better classrooms, but it does. Just this year the school had to shut down for days at a time as a result of a malfunction of the heating system. The roof of the library also had a leaking problem all winter long. The leaking has actually caused the ceiling tiles to rot to the point where they are having to be removed. It isn’t safe to sit underneath them because, in fact, they have fallen to tables where students had been working only minutes before. Another issue that people may be concerned with is the money that taxpayers have to put up for the building. The cost of the project in its entirety will be 2.9 million dollars, meaning that for the next 25 years, taxpayers would pay 40 cents more per thousand dollars in property tax than they do this year. The project does cost a significant amount of money, but the school needs it. If something isn’t done now, then the facilities such as the library, the science room and others will continue to grow steadily worse. The construction and remodeling needs to be done eventually, so why not now, when interest rates are low and expenses are also low. Superintendent __________ commented that it would cost the taxpayers much less money now than ten years from now. Another reason that this is a good time to pass this bond is that the results of Ballot Measure 5 are going into effect at the same time as the levy. As it stands now, property tax rates will go down another $2.50 by next year; however, if taxpayers don’t mind paying what they do now and can handle a 40 cent increase, then the school can be that much better. Many other good reasons we exist for funding this construction now. For one, better facilities will be made available to everyone: staff members, students, and community members. The new gym will allow student athletes to have earlier practices and more time for homework. With only one gym in a K–12 school system, the junior high has to practice in the morning before school, starting at 6:30 A.M., meaning that both the girls and boys teams had to practice at the same time, with half of the court for the girls half for the boys. After school, the high school girls would practice from 3:30 to 5:30 P.M. The varsity boys would then start at 5:30 or 6:00 and go until 7:30. After that, the junior varsity boys would come in for an hour and a half. It’s absurd to think that student athletes can make good use of their time with a schedule like that. If the bond were to pass, both the new gym and the present gym would be used for practices and athletes wouldn’t have to wait so long to practice every day. Another reason that the gym should be built is that it is no longer adequate. The bleachers are too close to the court and so there is no room to walk by without getting in the way during a game. The gym also poses a problem for the cheerleaders. As it is now, there is no room for them to cheer. They have to stand on one of the ends which, of course, is right in the way of people walking by. If a new gym were built, enough room would be provided surrounding the court that there wouldn’t be any of the problems there are now. Another advantage to the bond proposed is that it would provide more space in the school. The school has always been small, which is in some ways nice, but it needs to expand. The lack of space is a problem because everyone is crammed into one little hallway trying to make it around from class to class. As it is, there isn’t enough room for the library to just be a library or the kitchen to just be a kitchen. Students can’t even go to the library when they need to because Health, Media, and other classes are held there. The Satellite Learning classroom, which shares a space with the kitchen, usually has a difficult learning atmosphere each day people prepare food for the hot lunch program. Another problem area is the current science room and lab. Lab facilities are outdated and cannot be replaced
for a variety of reasons related to the plumbing and electrical systems. Both science teachers have said
publicly that the chemical storage room is inadequate and unsafe. The science curriculum is a core part
of students’ education and they deserve good facilities.
It is clear then, that __________ School needs significant improvements in which case the bond
must be passed. As a community, education is an essential part of the future. In the past, __________
has relied in the timber industry for employment, but times are changing and the younger generations
need to be better prepared to meet the challenges that arise. For example, they need to able to take
part in a variety of activities and be able to achieve in many different areas. If the school is inadequate,
how can the younger generations be provided with the education and training they need to be
successful in the future?",the school board have recently propose a bond levy to add new facility as well a conduct some major repair to the school the bond include build a new gymnasium a new science

10,"In the novel, Animal Farm, by George Orwell, there is one very particular character whose pride and selfishness creates problems. This character had just merely good ideas in the beginning. However, as time went on, his true self-interest began to shine through. This character started a free republic of animals and turned it into a plantation that used animals as slaves. He never did have enough and always wanted more, regardless of the price that others had to pay. This character whose pride and selfishness creates problems, is none other than the great leader of Animal Farm himself, comrade Napolean [Napoleon], the pig. Comrade Napolean is a powerful authority on Animal Farm. In fact he is the leader of Animal Farm and a high strung leader at that. After Old Major died, Napolean lived upon Old Major’s ideas. Napolean lead all the animals to rebellion so that Manor Farm ceized to exist, and Animal Farm was born. In the first year, he even worked the fields and helped bring in their biggest harvest ever. Little did the animals know, but he would soon change. Eventually the animals started receiving less food because Napolean needed more food to power his “large” brain. Later, he goes and runs off his successor, Snowball, so he can have the whole farm to himself. Then he stopped working the fields. He started taking young animals and selling them or using them for his own use. He stopped sleeping in the hay and slept in the farm house instead. Finally, he took away half the grain fields so he could plant barely to make himself beer. This Napolean was a power hungry, selfish individual for sure. Being power hungry, always causes problems, and boy did Napolean cause problems. The animals had received so little food that many were starving, you could see their bones, and some even died of starvation. Nopoleans’s lack of work meant the animals had to work harder, and it wasn’t easy on an empty stomach. Many animals would break their legs or hoofs but would continue to work. The lack of new workers due to Napolean’s selling them off, meant that nobody could retire, and one old animal even died in the fields. Snowball was a great teacher for the animals, and now that he was gone, they lacked education. Then with finally only half of the fields being productive for food, the animals starved even more and worked harder to make beer that they never saw. Not to mention that they had to sleep on a dirt floor while the lazy Napolean slept in his nice comfortable bed. His selfishness had deffinately created problems. Napolean’s experience had changed the farm drastically. He thought things were getting better while the animals knew they were only getting worse. After the rebellion, many humans disliked Animal Farm and the animals disliked humans. Nopoleans’s selfish ways were much like those of a farmer. So eventually as Napolean became more “human,” the town’s people began to like him. Napolean could care less about his animals, just so long as he was on good terms with the humans. By the novel’s end, Napolean is great friends with every human in town. However, his animal slaves are no longer happy as they once were. They still hate humans which means now, they hate Napolean. So due to Napolean’s pride, the story has changed its ways from start to finish. He has turned friends into foe and foe into friends, but at great cost. In the novel, Animal Farm, by George Orwell, Comrade Napolean is a character whose pride and selfishness creates problems. The starving animals have suffered greatly because of their leader’s pride. On the other hand, Napolean has gained great success through his selfishness. Unfortunately, that’s just the way it is. You can’t have pride without problems. Even if they are little problems, it’s still due to pride.

10,"Pride is often criticized by society and habitually seen as a negative characteristic evoking such connotations as conceit, egotism, arrogance, and hubris. In Richard Wright’s struggle to find his “place” in society in Black Boy, pride has both negative and positive connotations. Despite the negative consequences, pride allows Wright to maintain his moral compass, oppose conformity, and pursue his passion of writing, thus demonstrating pride’s positive influence on Wright’s life. Wright’s pride prompts him to make principled decisions and carry out actions that illustrate his morality and inherent beliefs. Wright refuses to neglect his values and chooses right over wrong even when he recognizes that failure to adhere to what is expected of him will ultimately result in negative and often violent consequences. When he receives the title of valedictorian and refuses to read the speech prepared for him by his principal, choosing instead to present his own speech in spite of the threat of being held back, Wright’s pride is demonstrated. Although he comprehends the consequences and the gravity of his decision, Wright refuses to compromise his beliefs: “I know that I’m not educated, professor . . . But the people are coming to hear the students, and I won’t make a speech that you’ve written” (174). Though urged by his family members and his classmates to avoid conflict and to comply with the principal’s demand, Wright refuses because he does not believe it is the morally correct thing to do. Even though his pride is negatively perceived by his peers and relatives as the source of defiance, they fail to realize that his pride is a positive factor that gives him the self confidence to believe in himself and his decisions. Wright’s refusal to acquiesce to his family’s ardent religious values is another illustration of his pride. Wright is urged by his family and friends to believe in God and partake in their daily religious routines; however, he is undecided about his belief in God and refuses to participate in practicing his family’s religion because “[His] faith, such as it was, was welded to the common realities of life, anchored in the sensations of [his] body and what [his] mind could grasp, and nothing could ever shake this faith, and surely not [his] fear of an invisible power” (115). He cannot put his confidence into something unseen and remains unwavering in his belief. Pride allows Wright to flee from the oppressive boundaries of expectations and to escape to the literary world. Wright’s thirst and desire to learn is prompted by his pride and allows him to excel in school and pursue his dreams of becoming a writer. The reader observes Wright’s pride in his writing when he wrote his first story. Pleased with his work, he “decided to read it to a young woman who lived next door . . . [He] looked at her in a cocky manner that said: . . . I write stuff like this all the time. It’s easy” (120-121). This attitude of satisfaction permits Wright to continue to push himself to improve and pursue his craft. Pride eventually leads Wright to submit his work to the local newspaper; his obvious pride in his work is clearly portrayed when he impatiently tells the newspaper editor, “But I want you to read it now” (165) and asks for his composition book back when he does not immediately show interest in his story. Pride in his academic achievements motivates him to excel in his studies; after Wright advanced to sixth grade in two weeks, he was elated and thrilled at his astonishing accomplishment: “Overjoyed, I ran home and babbled the news . . . I had leaped a grade in two weeks, anything seemed possible, simple, easy” (125). Wright’s pride in his intelligence and studies allows him to breeze through school: “I burned at my studies . . . I read my civics and English and geography volumes through and only referred to them in class. I solved all my mathematical problems far in advance” (133). Pride provides him with the selfconfidence and contentment that his family and society fail to give him. It removes Wright from both the black culture and the white culture and moves him rather to the “art culture”, in which Wright can achieve higher than what is anticipated of him. Wright’s ability to oppose conformity and forego the status quo also stems from his pride. Pride propels him to assert himself even if it defies what is expected of him as a black individual. Upon telling one of his old employers, a white woman, that he wants to be a writer, she indecorously scoffs at him and makes an impudent remark “You’ll never be a writer . . . Who on earth put such ideas into your head?” (147). This remark causes him to almost immediately quit his job; Wright remarks, “The woman
had assaulted my ego; she had assumed that she knew my place in life . . . what I ought to be, and I
resented it with all my heart” (147). Wright’s refusal to simply go along with what is expected of him,
thoroughly disappoints and aggravates his family and society, yet his pride has a positive influence on
his life; pride allows Wright to not only remove himself from the boundaries of the black vs. white society
and the insidious effect of racism but it also sets Wright free from the constraints of acceptance. Pride
ultimately frees Wright to pursue his passion and identify himself not as a black or white person but
rather as a “writer”.
In Wright’s struggle to overcome the overwhelming expectations he is faced with by society,
pride puts him at odds with his family and society but ultimately serves as a positive influence, allowing
him to withstand conformity and escape the status quo. This attitude allows Wright to maintain his
moral compass, believe in his self worth, and pursue his passion. Pride is more than pure arrogance and
haughtiness. To Wright, pride is something far greater; pride is the characteristic that gives him the
strength to march to his own beat; to the beat of the literary world.",pride be often criticize by society and habitually see a a negative characteristic evoke such connotation a conceit egotism

10,"For many years, scientists and researchers weren’t able to examine normal, healthy brains. They only got brain data from autopsies and surgeries. Even so, they were able to learn a lot about how the brain functioned because when people suffered brain damage to parts of the brain, they could see what functions were impaired and know the parts of the brain that were responsible for that function. MRI technology has changed that because now scientists can examine healthy brains at all stages of development, including getting functional results that show areas of the brain that “light up” while performing tasks. Therefore, scientists are now able to measure how the brain works. 95% of the brain has been formed by age 6, but through MRI studies researchers now know that changes in the brain structure continue to occur late in child development. The prefrontal cortex has a growth spurt just before puberty and then prunes back in adolescence. This part of the brain is responsible for reasoning, controlling impulses, and making judgments. The growth and pruning is a very important stage of brain development, so when this second wave is happening teen’s activities can affect how their brain responds for the rest of their lives. Researchers have found waves of growth and change in other parts of the brain as well, including the corpus callosum and the cerebellum. The corpus callosum influences language learning, and the cerebellum helps physical coordination and is also used to process mental tasks and higher thought such as math, philosophy, decision-making, etc. This recent research has confirmed what scientists have known for many years . . . that different parts of the brain mature at different times. However, the brain is much more changeable than previously thought, with structural changes taking place into adolescence and beyond. Knowing more about the brain’s structure is only one piece of the puzzle. Much more research is needed to draw conclusions about how the brain structure and function directly cause behavior. Conclusion: MRI technology has enabled researchers to learn much more about the brain’s growth and development. They have learned that parts of the brain, such as the pre-frontal cortex, an area of the brain that controls reasoning and judgment, goes through a second growth spurt just before puberty, and that this helps to explain why teenagers begin to have more control over their impulses and are able to make better judgments. Additionally, scientists have been able to confirm that some brain characteristics are genetic, and others are affected by environmental factors. Confirming that different parts of the brain mature at different times and that the brain has structural changes through adolescence is very important, but there is a great deal more research that needs to be done to learn about how brain structure and function relate to behavior. How is this article relevant to my future? Knowing more about the brain and how it influences behavior will have a major impact on how children and teenagers are raised and educated. For example, one of the researchers, Giedd believed that the growth and pruning can happen at a time of brain development when the actions of teenagers can affect them the rest of their lives, his “use it or lose it principle.” This is the time when music or academic development could be “hardwired.” This theory puts more emphasis on parents to make sure their teens have the right focus and guidance. Most parents already believe in a basic approach to raising and educating their children, but this research could lead to a very specific timetable and a do and don’t guide to child development, making sure that their child is exposed to the appropriate factors at the right time.",for many year scientist and researcher weren t able to examine normal healthy brain they only get brain data from

10,"I believe that it would be beneficial for our schools to adopt dress codes. Although some may argue that this action would restrict the individual student’s freedom of expression, I do not agree. Our right to express ourselves is important, but in our society none of us has unrestricted freedom to do as we like at all times. We must all learn discipline, respect the feelings of others, and learn how to operate in the real world in order to be successful. Dress codes would not only create a better learning environment, but would also help prepare students for their futures. Perhaps the most important benefit of adopting dress codes would be creating a better learning environment. Inappropriate clothing can be distracting to fellow students who are trying to concentrate. Short skirts, skimpy tops, and low pants are fine for after school, but not for the classroom. T-shirts with risky images or profanity may be offensive to certain groups. Students should espress themselves through art or creative writing, not clothing. With fewer distractions, students can concentrate on getting a good education which can help them later on. Another benefit of having a dress code is that it will prepare students to dress properly for different places. When you go to a party you do not wear the same clothes you wear to church. Likewise, when you dress for work you do not wear the same clothes you wear at the beach. Many professions even require uniforms.

10,"Children are blank slates that are subject to the environment around them. Allowing a child to interact with their surroundings is difficult for adults because it leaves each decision, and each consequence of that decision, up to them. Ellen Ruppel Shell believes that children miss out on experimenting and discovering aspects of the world that cannot be taught in a classroom or read about in a book. I agree that children can learn many important lessons about social interaction and the products of creativity by playing on their own, or with other children, in a free and open environment. To relieve the inevitable boredom that every child eventually encounters, they can nourish their creative minds by playing alone. As a child, I was content to sometimes play by myself in a land of make-believe. If it was cold and rainy outside, I would pretend it was the middle of summer. Night became day, my bedroom became a kingdom, my bed was a castle, my floor was a mote, and I was a princess. Playing “let’s pretend” allowed me to imagine and create my own world when reality seemed too mundane. “Boredom leads to exploration, which leads to creativity,” and nothing is more creative than a world that exists in the mind of a child. There are endless opportunities for parents to stimulate and teach their kids that come with instructions and rules and boundaries, but I agree with Shell when she declares that “the best play is spontaneous and unpredictable.” Plain and simple freedom is invaluable, and we are only so free as children. As we grow up, our minds become molded around society’s rules and we learn to conform to a certain way of thinking and creating. If adults see a soccer ball, they will only think of how to play soccer. If children see a soccer ball they will immediately create their own rules and proceed with an entirely different game. The ability to be spontaneous and imaginative is strongest in children because they know nothing else. Adults and parents that bombard their kids with structured activities are wasting the unique and innate ability of children to create; however, a parent’s reasoning for such structure is not unsupported. There are many life lessons that can be difficult to learn on your own, so adults establish controlled environments for their children to learn about the world. For example, making new friends can be an awkward and terrifying process for kids, so parents will try to make friends for their children. What most adults don’t realize is that they are robbing their child of a chance to open up and reach out to another person. The kid they meet on the jungle gym will be more beneficial to them than the kid their parent forced them to play with. “We don’t believe that they can navigate the world, so we try to navigate it for them.” Shell believes that adults need to trust their kids to discover the world for themselves and that it’s just as important for them to fail as it is for them to succeed. For children, it’s not about the final product, it’s how they get there. When forced to follow rules and obey boundaries, kids are not given the opportunity to use their imagination. I agree with Shell and I believe that it is more beneficial for children to make believe, be spontaneous, and discover as much as they can about the world for themselves.",child be blank slate that be subject to the environment around them allow a child to interact with their surroundings be difficult for adult because it leave each decision and each consequence of that decision up to them ellen ruppel shell believe that child miss out on experiment and discover aspect of the world that cannot be teach in a classroom or read about in a book i agree that child can learn many important lesson about social interaction and the product of creativity by play on their own or with other child in a free and open environment to relieve the inevitable boredom that every child eventually encounter they can nourish their creative mind by play alone a a child i be content to sometimes play by myself in a land of make believe if it be cold and rainy outside i would pretend it be the middle of summer night become day my bedroom become a kingdom my bed be a castle my floor be a mote and i be a princess playing let s pretend allow me to imagine and create my own world when reality seem too mundane boredom lead to exploration which lead to creativity and nothing be more creative than a world that exist in the mind of a child there be endless opportunity for parent to stimulate and teach their kid that come with instruction and rule and boundary but i agree with shell when she declare that the best play be spontaneous and unpredictable plain and simple freedom be invaluable and we be only so free a child a we grow up our mind become mold around society s rule and we learn to conform to a certain way of thinking and create if adult see a soccer ball they will only think of how to play soccer if child see a soccer ball they will immediately create their own rule and proceed with an entirely different game the ability to be spontaneous and imaginative be strong in child because they know nothing else adult and parent that bombard their kid with structured activity be waste the unique and innate ability of child to create however a parent s reason for such structure be not unsupported there be many life lesson that can be difficult to learn on your own so adults establish controlled environment for their child to learn about the world for example make new friend can be an awkward and terrify process for kid so parent will try to make friend for their child what most adults don t realize be that they be rob their child of a chance to open up and reach out to another person the kid they meet on the jungle gym will be more beneficial to them than the kid their parent force them to play with we don t believe that they can navigate the world so we try to navigate it for them shell believe that adult need to trust their kid to discover the world for themselves and that it s just a important for them to fail a it be for them to succeed for child it s not about the final product it s how they get there when force to follow rule and obey boundary kid be not give the opportunity to use their imagination i agree with shell and i believe that it be more beneficial for child to make believe be spontaneous and discover as much a they can about the world for themselves,"+ children are blank slates that are subject to the environment around them . + allowing a child to interact with their surroundings is difficult for adults because it leaves each decision , and each consequence of that decision , up to them . + ellen + ruppel + shell believes that children miss out on experimenting and discovering aspects of the world that cannot be taught in a classroom or read about in a book .

10,"America in the years leading up to 1918 was as confident in its medical ability as it had ever been. In only one century, it had seen the successful vaccination, containment, or cure for the notorious menaces of smallpox, anthrax, rabies, meningitis, typhoid, malaria, yellow fever, diphtheria, cholera, and tetanus.2 Due to the new strides in bacteriology, germ theory, and sanitation, as well as new methods devised to control food-, water-, and insect-borne diseases, Americans were experiencing an era of unprecedented health. Whereas in all previous wars, more American soldiers were lost to disease than in action, American troops in World War I saw an all-time low in the number of deaths due to disease. Army camp inspections, carried out by William Henry Welch, the respected doctor and assistant to the Army Surgeon General, revealed that, though camps were overcrowded, “the health of the army proved to be as good as any reasonable doctor could expect.”3 Unfortunately, the new light that had been shed on disease control did not apply to air-borne viruses. Because neither antibiotics nor a way to control the spread of air-borne diseases had been invented yet, America was as vulnerable to the deadly grip of influenza that would befall it in 1918 as Medieval Europe had been to the Bubonic Plague of the 14th century. More people died of the Spanish Flu in the 10 months that it devastated the world than had died of any other disease or war in history. A commonly cited estimate of deaths is 21 million worldwide, yet prominent demographer Kingsley Davis estimates that the disease killed approximately 20 million in the Indian subcontinent alone.4 The actual number of deaths will never be known, but the modern estimate is somewhere between 50 and 100 million.5 If an equal percentage of the world population died today, that would be close to 2 billion victims.6 A bare minimum of 550,000 Americans, or .5 percent of the American population, died in the apocalyptic pandemic.7 Yet, due to some historical and demographic particulars of the 1918 flu, the American economy—which nearly collapsed in some areas during the outbreak—was not crippled in any lasting way. The flu is not generally thought of as a killer. Instead, it is perceived as a pesky annual virus, slightly more troublesome than the common cold, but nothing serious. In reality, the average yearly flu is an extremely virulent disease, infecting anywhere from 30 to 60 million Americans annually, of whom about 36,000 die (usually the very old or the very young.)8 It mutates so frequently that humans are never fully immune to it, so a yearly vaccine must be produced to counteract it, whereas most viruses require only one vaccination in a lifetime.9 The killer flu of 1918, dubbed the Spanish Flu or the Spanish Lady, was a particularly deadly mutation of this influenza virus.10 In comparison to the .1 percent of infected who die of the annual flu, it killed 2.5 percent of those who contracted it.11 This mutation had a propensity to cause pneumonia, untreatable at the time, and clogged its victims’ lungs with bloody sputum until their faces turned dark purple and they died of suffocation.12 The origins of the Spanish Flu are uncertain, but most experts believe that the first wave in the U.S. emerged in Fort Riley, Kansas, on March 11, 1918, when one of the men came down with a milder form of the mysterious illness.13 As of the next day, 414 soldiers had contracted the virus, and by the end of the week at least 500 were sick.14 In total, 48 men died from the first influenza-pneumonia strain by the time it had run its course in the camp—too low a number to merit any concern in the medical community in 1918.15 Even though the virus struck at least 13 other military camps, there was sparse evidence that civilians were similarly affected, and, besides, disease was a fact of life in any military camp.16 So, little attention was directed to the budding pandemic. America instead focused on the new draft calls, the war in Europe, the suffragette movement, and the Bolshevik tumult in Russia, while ignoring the mild outbreak of a hard-to-identify flu.17 As expected, the flu subsided quickly with a forgettable number of casualties. Unforeseen, however, was the deadlier second wave that would emerge that August to explode in September with unprecedented virulence. Influenza viruses thrive in cold, dry weather, which is why flu season tends to
be during the winter.18 The fact that it exploded like it did in August, which is neither cold nor dry, makes
this flu remarkable. The epidemic first struck Camp Devens, an overcrowded military camp thirty miles
from Boston, on September 8 after brewing in Europe for about a month.19 From there, it spread to the
rest of the United States in an unsettlingly erratic manner, hitting most of the East coast, then some of the
Midwest and the Gulf Coast region, then the West coast, and ultimately striking the interior.20 Although at
times slow in reaching certain regions, the Spanish Flu was horrifyingly thorough in its damages.
Nearly every city in the United States was affected economically by the flu in the short-term. In
many places, the workforce was paralyzed because 21-to-29-year-olds suffered the greatest casualties.21
So many people died at uncommonly young ages that the average life expectancy dropped 12 years,
from 51 in 1917 to 39 in 1918.22 Whether or not the infected had been young, healthy, and robust prior
to contracting the flu was of little consequence. The military, which consisted of a particularly young,
healthy, and robust demographic, was hit the hardest of any social group in America: 40 percent of
the Navy and 36 percent of the Army developed the flu in 1918.23 With victims’ average age being 33,
the volume of death claims by flu victims blind-sided the life insurance companies.24 One life insurance
company handled $24 million worth of unanticipated death claims for 68,000 deaths.25 The fact that
the majority of victims were in the prime of their lives defied actuarial projections, confusing insurance
companies, destroying families, and disrupting the economy at large.
In the most severe stages of the flu, the “essential services” of cities verged on collapse as
policemen, firemen, garbage collectors, telephone operators, and even the doctors, nurses, and social
workers who were struggling to fight the flu, were absent from work.26 The Bureau of Child Hygiene
strove to handle an overwhelming population of orphans as the fathers and mothers of America, those
in the most vulnerable age-range, were decimated by influenza.27 Employment standards plummeted,
the only requirement in some places being “two hands and willingness to work.”28 Worst off of any
“essential service” were the processors of the dead. As morgues filled up, in some places with bodies
stacked three and four high, corpses accumulated in the streets, spreading bacteria and the residual
influenza virus.29 In some situations, the dead were left untended, festering in their homes for days.30 The
primary emergency during the flu was in these “essential services,” which could not have held out much
longer than they did. While those services continued functioning, even at a minimal level, the rest of the
economy was able to rebound to normal capacity within three years, the “Roaring Twenties” as evidence
of this resilience. Despite the chaos, the nation persisted.
In The Review of Economic Statistics of December 1919, the year 1919 was deemed a “year of
readjustment,” one in which the United States was healing from the tensions of 1918.31 According to the
article, in 1918, “industries were straining their energies to meet the unusual demands occasioned by the
war,” yet it should be noted that the strain was also partially due to the Spanish Flu.32 In one county in
West Virginia, during the fall of 1918, the three months of flu had left 6,000 ill, of whom 500 died.33 This
sapped the county economy to near-collapse as 80 percent of the labor force fell ill.34 Coupled with the
large population overseas for the war, situations like this compromised cities across the nation, especially
with Surgeon General of the Army William Crawford Gorgas shipping thousands of America’s fittest
young doctors and nurses to Europe, where he believed they were most necessary.35 The doctors and
nurses who continued to serve at home, like many of the civilians who remained, were generally too old,
or too young, or too disabled to adequately respond to the Spanish Flu.36
When the epidemic reached cities with a deficient work force and incompetent, sparse medical
care, the critical damage to the economy was compounded by restrictive public health ordinances. In
an effort to restrict exposure to the virus, the Surgeon General had issued public health ordinances that
prohibited most public gatherings and required gauze masks to be worn at all times.37 In Philadelphia
alone, it is estimated that theaters, cinemas, and hotels lost $2 million to the flu from the ordinances, while
saloons lost $350,000.38 These ordinances turned out to be fairly pointless: even in places that strictly
adhered to the recommendations of the Surgeon General the case and death rates were no lower than
those in lenient cities.39 On a smaller scale, tobacco sales dropped off about 50 percent in places that
strictly required cotton face masks because men could not smoke while wearing masks.40 These masks
turned out to be completely ineffective, because the weave of the gauze proved too porous to stop a virus,
usually a tiny sphere with a diameter of about 1/10,000 of a millimeter.41 The futile public health ordinances
and gauze masks temporarily damaged business during the flu crisis, yet the economy rebounded.
When contagious diseases attack a society, it tends to hit the poorest sector of economy the
hardest. One of the reasons for this is that they are more prone to infect people who have cramped living quarters, poor hygiene, inadequate water and food supplies, and exposure to parasites—some
of the consequences of poverty.42 Because the working class would be disproportionately affected
by disease, the work force would be disproportionately affected by disease, the work force would be
disproportionately diminished in the lowest-paying, most essential jobs during an epidemic. By contrast,
the Spanish Flu, being an air-borne disease (and thus not preventable through good hygiene and
health), affected all sectors of the economy equally. It killed vast numbers of people, but, as noted by
historian Alfred W. Crosby, it “ignored the differences between rural and urban, patrician and peasant,
capitalist and proletarian, and struck them all down in similar proportions.”43 Because it was so unbiased
in its selection, no social hierarchies were overturned, nor were any particular divisions of employment
gutted of laborers. Influenza’s only prejudice was that it ravaged the young, healthy age-range—
something fairly irrelevant to economic status—and thus the only long-term economic imbalance was
proportional: there were fewer people to work and fewer people sharing in the wealth.
Although the Spanish Flu killed a lower percentage of the population than it affected and lasted
for a shorter period of time, the economic benefits of the epidemic can be compared to those of the
Black Death. One of the peculiar positive effects of the Black Death, according to historian Norman
Davies, was that it marked “the decisive point in the decline of the feudal system in Western Europe.”44
Although social upheaval may have already been gaining momentum, the deadly epidemic that killed
approximately one-third of Europe allowed formerly impoverished and powerless serfs to assert their
independence.45 With an absence of competition in the work force and a high demand for menial labor,
serfs were able to gain comparative economic freedom with rising pay.46 This escalation of the price of
labor and goods during the plague is echoed in the aftermath of the Spanish Flu epidemic. The Review
of Economic Statistics of December 1919 observes the post-influenza wage inflation, noting that the
“efficiency of labor, unfortunately, has not materially improved and is still generally below the prewar level,” yet “rates of wages have remained high during 1919 and have continued to rise rather than
decline.”47 The Review also remarks on the oddity that “unemployment has not developed, in spite of
the demobilization of the army; and in many sections labor is still reported to be scarce.”48 The unusually
high wages and low labor supply despite the re-absorption of troops into the work force could be
attributed to the fact that so many people had succumbed to the pandemic on the home front that the
re-entry of troops had normalized, rather than overwhelmed, the labor market.
In the years following 1918, the influenza pandemic, though surely seared in the memories of
those it personally affected, quickly subsided from national consciousness.49 Even during the epidemic,
the flu was rarely mentioned in the papers or truly noticed on a national level. As noted by Crosby, “The
Reader’s Guide to Periodical Literature, 1919-1921 has 13 inches of column space devoted to citations of
articles about baseball, 20 inches to Bolshevism, 47 to Prohibition, and 8 inches to the flu.”50 As the United
States emerged victorious from the devastations of World War I, the brief but deadly nightmare of the
Spanish Flu was lost to the national memory. The war had put pressure on Americans to sacrifice as much
as possible: the government urging people to grow what food they could, eat less meat and fewer luxury
foods, buy war bonds, and serve in the army as required by the draft. Wartime America was dealing
with death on a regular basis as the war casualties continued to grow, ultimately reaching approximately
117,000 deaths—about 53,000 in battle, the remainder due to disease.51 With such a high proportion of
war losses due to disease and the influenza deaths accompanying the hardships on the home front, the
flu must have seemed so intricately enmeshed in the reality of war that it became unremarkable.
After the war had ended and the flu had essentially run its course in most places, the thrifty
attitudes about consumption enforced by the war effort and the strict public health ordinances were
immediately discarded. Americans had a brief attention span for such restrictions—they were only
heeded during the war for patriotic reasons or in the midst of a deadly, dramatic pandemic. The Review
of Economic Statistics of December 1919 remarked that “extravagant expenditure, both public and
private, is found on every hand.”52 San Franciscans—who endured the worst hit of the Spanish Flu on
the West Coast—had complied with the October-November 1918 masking ordinance that had required
gauze masks be worn at all times.53 Yet, a mid-December masking recommendation of that same year
met the fierce opposition of 90 percent of the city and was struck down by the San Francisco Board
of Supervisors.54 The intolerance for what were thought at the time to be potentially life-saving health
measures reflects the prevalent mood at the time of impatience with inconvenience that trumped even
fear of death.
Perhaps the Spanish Flu would have drawn more attention if only it had left the scar of a long
depression in its wake. Yet, after the crippling 10 months of the flu, the American economy was not only undamaged, but booming. Following the “year of readjustment” of 1919, the United States experienced a
sunny era of unprecedented prosperity.55 The national income, which had remained stagnant from 1890 to
1918, rose more than $200 per capita and laborers enjoyed a workday diminished from 12 to eight hours,
as well as a paid annual vacation.56 With the advent of mass-production due to the innovations of the
assembly line and expanded industrial exploitation of electricity, productivity soared to unheard-of levels.57
In the mere 30 years between 1899 and 1929, industrial production expanded by 264 percent.58 All of this
was accomplished by a manufacturing labor pool that, according to historian William E. Leuchtenburg
in his book The Perils of Prosperity, contained “precisely the same number of men in 1929 as it had in
1919.”59 The workforce to attain these new heights was the same workforce that been described in 1919 as
generally sufficient, yet which was in many sectors “still reported to be scarce.”60 In the same way that the
Renaissance thrived in the wake of the Black Plague by benefiting from capital redistribution to a greater
demographic, the destruction of the Spanish Flu had opened up a decade of culture and materialism to a
population that benefited from the resulting availability of jobs and higher wages.
With thousands of the fittest soldiers, doctors, and nurses overseas and the stress of coping
with wartime and its strict economic regulations, a flu epidemic was the last thing that Americans of 1918
needed, or expected. It was especially traumatic when even the enormous strides that had been made
in recent years in the medical community were insufficient to control this epidemic of a traditionally
unobtrusive disease. Disturbingly, young, healthy adults were the most likely to succumb to the virus
and die of a violent, delirious pneumonia. With the backbone of the economy debilitated and inept
medical care, U.S. society could have collapsed. However, the flu lasted for a short enough time that it
did not permanently disable the workforce. Also, because the primary target was an age-group rather
than a class, the virus infected different socioeconomic sectors evenly. As a consequence, though
in many places the workforce was reduced to the point of near-collapse, the population retained its
socioeconomic balance. Finally, because the flu took place for 10 months during and after World War I,
the most devastated demographic was replaced by the return of soldiers who could then be reabsorbed
easily into society, thereby alleviating the labor-pool crisis. From the perspective of its victims and
their loved ones, the 1918 influenza was a tragedy; however, viewed within an economic paradigm, the
Spanish Lady smoothed the transition from the turbulence of the 19th and early 20th centuries into the
prosperity of the 1920s.",america in the year lead up to be a confident in it medical ability a it have ever be in only one century it have see the successful vaccination containment or cure for the

10,"The modern world is full of problems and issues—disagreements between peoples that stem from today’s wide array of perceptions, ideas, and values. Issues that could never have been foreseen are often identified and made known today because of technology. Once, there were scatterings of people who had the same idea, yet never took any action because none knew of the others; now, given our complex forms of modern communication, there are millions who have been connected. Today, when a new and arguable idea surfaces, the debate spreads across the global community like wildfire. Topics that the general public might never have become aware of are instantly made into news that can be discussed at the evening dinner table. One such matter, which has sparked the curiosity of millions, is the recent interest in the classification of literature as fiction or nonfiction. A number of questions have arisen: What sparked the booming interest? Where exactly is the line that separates fiction from nonfiction, and how far can the line be stretched until one becomes the other? Are there intermediaries between the two, or must we classify each piece of literature as one or the other? Do authors do this purposefully, or with no intent? The answers to these questions are often circular and simply lead to further dispute. In modern times, the line between the classification of literature as either fiction or nonfiction has become blurred and unclear; the outdated definitions and qualifications have sparked the development of new genres and challenged the world’s idea on the differences between the two. The Spark Which Lit the Fire Though it had been a fairly relevant and known topic to members of the literary world, the idea that a book is not always completely fiction or nonfiction seemed to be an obscure and unnecessary subject for the public to ponder. However, the average Monday morning watercooler conversation was forever changed when what has become known as the “Million Little Lies Scandal” broke out in early 2006. It started on October 26, 2005 when author James Frey appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show. He was the only guest of the day, there to promote and discuss his book entitled A Million Little Pieces. The book, a nonfiction memoir, recounts Frey’s experience as an alcoholic, drug addict, and criminal, and the heroic story of his overcoming of every obstacle in his path to getting clean. After his appearance on the show and addition into Oprah’s highly esteemed and publicized book club, the novel skyrocketed to the top of the charts, eventually becoming a number one best seller. But his success was short lived; in the months that followed, The Smoking Gun, a Web site that posts legal documents, arrest records, and investigates celebrity police dealings, unearthed some discrepancies between Frey’s story and the police documents that should have supported his claims. Though the Web site had originally only been searching for Frey’s mugshot, one small inconsistency soon led to another, and after a six-week investigation, the site released its findings. Investigators had taken any parts of Frey’s story that could be verified by a police record, matched it with his actual records, and were shocked by what they found; nearly all of Frey’s memoir was either highly embellished or flat out fabricated. Huge discrepancies between the truth and what was stated in Frey’s book became headline news; instances like Frey claiming to be in jail for eighty-seven days when in reality he was incarcerated for a mere four hours, or the serious drug charges that he claimed were filed against him that were never found on any record. Frey was caught, and on January 8, 2006, The Smoking Gun published an article called “A Million Little Lies,” which took an in-depth look at every provable inconsistency in the novel. By comparing direct quotes from the book to police records—or rather, the lack of police records—Frey’s entire novel was pieced apart until there was nothing remaining. Completely discredited, yet still somehow maintaining the entire situation was a misunderstanding, Frey attempted to salvage his namesake by reappearing on Oprah; in the end, this proved to be more damaging than helpful. He had his reasons for what he’d done, he tried to explain. Reasons that were valid and legitimate according to him, as he stated that he would not have been Lincoln; the trial of the only woman associated with his murder; the society of Washington, D.C., at the
time of his death; the history behind the practice of grave robbing) and inserts the character of a young
girl and her dying mother who, between the two of them, manage to tell the historical side of the story
along with their own imagined one. All the pieces of history are told completely as they happened; so on
some level, this novel is nonfiction. Yet it is also blatantly fiction—it has characters.
New journalism, biographies, and autobiographies, however, blur the lines in a slightly different way; they
call into question people’s ability to relay information truthfully and with no bias. New journalism is the
term coined in the 1960s to describe the then unconventional journalism techniques that brought the
reader inside the life and mind of the story. It’s a practice very common today; just watch any network
investigation series. The journalist attempts to get inside the mind of whomever is being investigated; he
or she digs up information regarding that person’s past, present, and potential future. The author then
takes all the factual background information they’ve collected and pairs it with the emotions, memories,
and feelings described to them by the person, and writes the complete story. If the complete work is to
be published as a book rather than a news article or made into a television script, it often ends up being
sold as a fiction novel. Yet is this the correct classification, given that all the information is true?
One excellent example of new journalism is Truman Capote’s In Cold Blood. When asked about it, Capote
himself even called it “unclassifiable.” Capote traveled to Kansas to investigate the murder of a family of
four; he ended up staying there for years, befriending the people of the town, discovering what he could
about the murders from them, and piecing together his book from interviews and information he gained
during his stay. When it was published, the novel became a best seller and also one of the first highly
noted pieces of literature to border the line between fiction and nonfiction; it was the first of its kind to
bring the idea of the blurring line to households across the United States.
Biographies and autobiographies are often questioned in the same way. Though not always thought of
as controversial and previously considered nonfiction, biographies and autobiographies don’t appear to
fit into today’s definition of fiction or nonfiction. The authors of both are simply telling the story of their
own life or of someone else’s life, but that begs an obvious question; is a highly detailed, written record
of a person’s feelings and perceptions able to be considered nonfiction? How can we classify people’s
emotions and memories as fact? An outstanding example of an autobiographical piece that cannot be
defined is Tim O’Brien’s The Things They Carried. His self-proclaimed ‘nonfiction novel’ is a collection
of stories stemming from both his imagination and his personal experience in Vietnam during the war.
O’Brien feels that the idea of creating a story that is technically false yet truthfully portrays a situation—
as opposed to just stating the facts and stirring no emotion within the reader—is the correct way to
educate the public in a meaningful, everlasting way. He, like many others, believes that biographies and
autobiographies should be left as their own separate being; a genre where the reader may classify for
himself or herself what truth and what fiction might lie within the literature. All of the issues mentioned
above are shrouded in debate; there are no straightforward answers.
Fiction and nonfiction are two polar opposites on a scale that today offers little to no gradient. In years
past, these two words have been definition enough and have managed to encompass all types of written
word. Times change, however, and in the modern day, authors have begun to push the boundaries and
discover the furthest extent of where literature can take us. Since they feel as if their literature does not
fit into the classifications of fiction or nonfiction, authors are creating new genres where their novels and
books can be properly sorted and defined. An update is long overdue—both an update to the definitions
currently used to classify books, and an update in which we create new areas into which books can be
classified.
able to get the book signed unless he was willing to sell it as nonfiction. Details had been slightly
exaggerated, he conceded, but this was only to allow the novel to fluctuate and flow in a way that would
not have been possible had he stuck to the bare facts.
Regardless, in the end, it was proved beyond anyone’s reasonable doubt that James Frey’s novel landed
dead center in the proverbial grey area between black and white—his novel was partially fiction and
partially nonfiction. And so started the media frenzy; the scandal covered newsstands for weeks, people
took sides with either Frey or his critics, and similarly themed novels were called into question. Suddenly
the world cared about a novel’s validity; they no longer assumed that the words fiction and nonfiction
could themselves define the amount of fact that stood behind a piece of literature. People also realized,
simultaneously, that they might not exactly know what defined and separated fiction and nonfiction, or
if, in more modern times, the two might mesh together a bit more than in the literature of old.
With Difficulty, the Line is Drawn
Fiction and nonfiction: they’re two words that are surprisingly hard to define. It’s difficult to ascertain
what the words have meant in the past, what they each encompass today, and how past and present
definitions have been molded and shaped by the literature of the time. Traditionally, fiction is ‘a tale
drawn from the imagination’ and nonfiction is ‘a statement of fact’; however, the two are so much more
complex than that. For many, the word ‘fiction’ is associable with the word ‘story,’ as if the two are
equal or interchangeable. Subgenres of fiction often contribute to this perception; novels, short stories,
fairy tales, comics, films, animation, and even video games help the mind classify fiction as a substance
completely fabricated in the mind. Fiction is largely assumed to be a form of art or entertainment, and in
many cases this is true—science fiction and romance novels are two examples of how we are entertained
by a good book. But frequently, stories are told to educate—to raise awareness regarding a certain topic
about which the author is concerned.
Stories like Cormac McCarthy’s The Road, George Orwell’s 1984, and Ayn Rand’s Anthem all warn us
about terrible futures that may arise as the result of the choices of humanity. Uzodinma Iweala’s Beasts
of No Nation is a short work of fiction based entirely around fact; while it tells the tale of a fictional little
African boy thrown into a bloody civil uprising, his story of being a recruited child soldier is happening
to hundreds of similar boys to this very day. Fables and parables are other, more subliminal examples of
educational, moral-based fiction.
In the same way, nonfiction is surrounded by many presumptions; people assume that anything read
in a nonfiction book is true, otherwise the literature would be labeled as fiction. Nonfiction literature
is factual literature, but there is one important note to make. Nonfiction is literature that is presented
as fact. This presentation may be accurate or inaccurate; in other words, the author is presumed to
be writing what he or she believes to be the truth, or what he or she has been led to believe is the
truth. Examples of nonfiction include essays, documentaries, scientific papers, textbooks, and journals.
Nonfiction differs from fiction, however, in the areas regarding how the literature is presented and used.
Directness, simplicity, and clarity are all aims of nonfiction literature.
Providing straight, accessible, understandable information to the reader is the purpose of nonfiction, and
the ability to communicate well to the audience is what defines a skilled writer of the field. And despite
the truth behind nonfiction writing, it is often necessary to persuade the reader to agree with the ideas
being presented; therefore, a balanced, coherent and informed argument is also vital.
More Than Simply Black or White
The line between fiction and nonfiction starts to blur, however, when one considers genres that seem to
mesh the two; historical fiction, new journalism, and biographies/autobiographies. These are only three
of the defined new genres encompassed by what has become the intermediary between fiction and
nonfiction— literary nonfiction. When one explores these three genres, it becomes blaringly obvious how
easily fiction and nonfiction can blur into one.
Historical fiction is the product when an author takes real people and real events and tells the story
of what actually happened to them, but inserts characters of their own creation and a plot line that
they invent in order to tie the entire novel together. This idea is perfectly exampled in Ann Rinaldi’s
An Acquaintance with Darkness.

10,"The violin is arguably the most cherished and well-known orchestral instrument in the world. Many are moved by its unique quality of sound; it is known as the only instrument close to the sound of a human voice. Maybe the violin is so revered because “humans in all times and places are powerfully moved, or threatened, by the possibility that with our hands and minds we can create something that is perfect” (Ebert). But the sound of this instrument was not magically created overnight; the creation of the very first violin took many years and has been a product of much experimentation. This is the reason that every beginning violinist should learn to appreciate the art of making a violin and the process of holding and bowing his instrument so that he will have the knowledge to play it well. The process of constructing a violin is an age-old tradition that has been developed and refined for centuries. Each step is crucial to the quality of the instrument’s sound. The violin’s body consists of a rib structure, which is made from six thin maple ribs that are bent to shape by applying dry heat. The ribs are reinforced at the joints by wood blocks that are located in each of the four outward curving corners, one at the top rib, and one at the lower rib. To reinforce the glue-joints between the ribs and the table and back of the violin, strips of willow or pine are glued along the inside edges of the ribs to create the lining. The back plate of the violin is made from either one or two matched pieces of maple. The wood chosen for these pieces is very important and affects the sound production of the violin. The outline of the plate is drawn onto the maple and sawn out, and the arching (the outward bulge) is then painstakingly carved to a thickness of about five millimeters. The front plate of the violin, or table, has two soundholes carved from it on either side of the bridge. These soundholes are [shaped like the letter f] and are made to project the sound. Purfling is done by inlaying thin strips of wood around the top and back of the violin a short distance from the rim. Purfling strengthens the delicate edgework and produces a beautiful frame around the instrument’s outline (Gusset). The bridge is cut from a thin sliver of maple. Intricate shapes are carved from it, known as the “heart,” “ears,” and the two “feet” that allow it to stand on the violin table. The bridge is placed directly between the small nicks cut in the middle of each [soundhole]. The top of the bridge is curved to conform to the arch of the violin table, which allows the player to play each string individually (Skinner). The bridge is held onto the instrument by as much as seventeen pounds of pressure exerted from the four strings, which makes it a very delicate piece that must be checked periodically for leaning or warping. A bassbar is fitted to the underside of the table underneath the left foot of the bridge. Underneath the right foot of the bridge, a soundpost is wedged between the front and back panel. The soundpost is made of spruce or pine and resists the downward pressure of the strings and improves the sound. A neck is fitted to the top rib and is made to hold the fingerboard above the table. The fingerboard is a piece of ebony that extends beyond the neck and gradually widens towards the bridge. At the top of the neck is a pegbox that has holes drilled into each side in which the pegs are held. The pegs are used for a wide range of tuning. The pegbox slopes slightly backwards, which tensions the strings across the ebony nut at the top of the fingerboard and keeps them raised above the fingerboard. At the top of the pegbox is a scroll, added during the baroque period as an artistic flourish to provide an aesthetic touch to its already pleasing appearance (Vienna Online Magazine). The strings are wrapped around the pegs, stretched across the bridge, and held by an ebony or boxwood tailpiece. Anywhere from one to four fine tuners can be attached to the tailpiece; these are used to tighten or loosen the string to change its pitch for fine-tuning. The tailpiece is held into place by a loop of gut or nylon that is wrapped around an ebony end button located in the middle of the bottom rib. After gluing is done, the violin must be exposed to air and sun for several days to a few weeks to darken the wood through the process of oxidation (Gusset). A protective varnish is brushed onto the surface of the violin, which has a slight dampening effect to the sound, but it is primarily used to protect the wood from perspiration, dust, dirt, and humidity (Kolneder 21). “The classical Italian makers appear to have used different formulations for the ground coat, which seals and protects the wood and does much to bring out its natural beauty, and the top coats, which were tinted with rich red, yellow and golden-brown colours . . . Recent research suggests that walnut or linseed oil may have been an important constituent
of the finest old Italian varnish, later supplanted by recipes based on shellac and alcohol” (Stowell 5).
Both the construction of the violin and the way it is played are equally important to its sound
production. This is very critical to learn early so that a bad habit does not need correcting later on.
The modern violin is held between the chin and the left shoulder, with the scroll angling towards the
left. Violin teachers will have varying ideas of the correct position to hold a violin, but many great
violinists have held their instruments in different ways and have been successful. Some will hold a violin
directly under the chin, and others believe that the highest position on the shoulder is best. A chinrest
is usually attached to the left side of the tailpiece to make it more comfortable for the violinist to hold.
Sometimes a shoulder rest can be attached to the back of the violin which can be taken off after playing.
The shoulder rest can be made of various materials and provides height and padding to the violinist’s
shoulder.
The left hand gently moves along the neck and fingerboard of the violin. The left fingers press down
upon the string, shortening its length, which creates a higher pitch. The right hand holds the bow, which
consists of a long stick of wood and a gathering of horsehair stretched from one end of the bow to
the other. “In the bowing area, two C-shaped indentations (the waist) accommodate the bow’s motion
across the strings” (Kolneder 13). The four strings can be bowed with the horsehair, plucked, or bounced
with the stick of the bow to produce vastly different colors of sound. “Bowing across the string is the
normal manner of tone production, but the process is actually extremely complicated and in its most
minute details not yet entirely understood . . . The strings’ basic pitch depends on its length, thickness,
material . . . and tension. These factors determine the frequency, that is, the number of vibrations . . . per
second” (Kolneder 16). The bow must be rosined frequently to allow the strings to vibrate to create the
fullest sound.
Even if a luthier, or stringed instrument maker, takes years to complete a violin, it can only produce its
best sound if every step of its construction and every piece is made with is of the best quality. The same
is true of the time needed for a musician to play the violin well. A player must learn that what counts is
not how much time is spent practicing, but the quality of practice. A private teacher is also required, so
proper instruction will be given. A musician must also fully understand and appreciate the skill required
for constructing a violin. Not until then will a violinist be able to use his knowledge to bring forth their
instrument’s fullest and most beautiful sound.

10,"Have you ever wondered how to design complex wood joinery? The types of wood joinery have been
around for thousands of years. There are only twelve different main types of joints but there are many
that combine more than one for aesthetics or strength. The first step in designing joints is understanding
the different types and what their uses are. After you understand the strengths and weaknesses of the
different joints you can compare and contrast the joints for aesthetics. This and a lot of practice are what
make excellent wood joinery.
The first step in designing joints is to figure out what way the wood will move so it won’t destroy the
joint. Then figure in the stresses that will be put on the joint. The three types of stresses on joints are
compression, tension, and shear. Compression is the weight pushing down on another piece and making
it crush down. Tension is things being pulled apart. Shear is when a piece breaks off when overloaded.
There are two categories of joints there are sawed joints and shaped joints. A sawed joint is one that can
be cut in one pass with a saw. The shaped joints can be complicated and take multiple cuts. Joints are
either made to lock together which are the shaped ones or to make glue surfaces to glue together which
are the sawed ones. The twelve types of joints are the butt joints, miter joints, rebate joints, dado joints,
groove joints, and lap joints are sawed joints. Scarf joints, finger joints, dovetails, mortise and tenon,
dowel joints, and spline joints are shaped joints.
To lay out good joints there are a few tools necessary. You need a good square that is accurate, a steel
ruler for measuring, a miter square, a sliding bevel, a protractor, and a caliper. The square is to draw
perfect ninety-degree lines. The miter square is so you can check your miters for accuracy. The sliding
bevel and protractor is to draw angles other than forty-five degrees. The caliper is to make sure the
pieces getting joined are the right thickness.
For a good joint the fit should be tight. But if it is too tight it is not good because the wood joint could
crack or break. It should be tight enough that you can either push it together or give it a light tap with a
hammer to seat it. Another reason it can’t be too tight is because when the glue is applied the wood will
expand. Then it may not fit. The reason the wood expands is because putting the glue on is like putting
water on it.
The way to make a tight joint is in the layout. A marking knife is a lot more accurate than a pencil. Also
make sure you use the same ruler throughout the project because there could be slight variations in
different ones. Always mark the waste side of the line and make sure you follow on the right side of the
line. If you cut on the wrong side of the line it will not be tight enough.
Now that you know what tools to use the next thing in tight joinery is to make sure all the pieces are the
same thickness or the thickness needed. Boards should be cut to a rough length so they are easier to
run through the machines. This will leave less room for error because the pieces won’t be so bulky. Also
make sure that the plywood is the thickness it’s claimed to be because it could be off 1/64 of an inch.
Whenever possible trace the mate for the joint to ensure a good fit.
If the joint is cut too small there are four different repairs. You can fill small gaps with a mixture of
sawdust of the same species of wood and glue. For loose parts you can add shims and sand or file to fit.
You could also make a design feature for loose parts. A slot cut in the end of a loose tenon with a wedge
put in it makes a nice design feature. But if it is real noticeable you should just replace it. When buying
lumber, always make sure you buy a couple of extra boards for mistakes or defects you didn’t notice
when you bought it.
Out of the twelve different joints, I’ll start with the ones easiest to make. Butt joints are the easiest joints
to make. A butt joint is wood joined face to edge or edge to end. There are several ways to attach the
two pieces. They can be nailed or screwed together but should have a pilot hole drilled or the pieces
may split. Corrugated or metal fasteners can be used. Also you can make wooden triangles or blocks to strengthen up corners. The pieces can also be doweled together, which is one of the stronger ways to
attach the two pieces. The two pieces can also be biscuit jointed together which is another fairly strong
way to attach them.
Another fairly simple joint is the lap joint. The lap joint is where the two pieces of wood to be joined are
cut so only half the thickness of each piece is left. They are then glued, nailed, or screwed together. The
lap joint is mostly used for frames that will have plywood on them. The joint is also used in latticework,
which is used for decoration in different pieces of furniture. The downside to this joint is that it isn’t very
strong but it does look nice in some applications.
The next joint is a little more complicated but still fairly simple. The only thing complicated about the
miter joint is figuring out the angles for different shapes. A square is simple but you have to make sure
the saw is exactly square or the joints won’t fit tight. But as you get into different sided shapes the
angles are harder to figure out, especially if they have to be a compound miter. That is where it is cut on
an angle in two different directions. The miter joint looks good because there is no end grain but it isn’t
very strong. But biscuits can be added for some extra strength.
The next joint is the dado joint. Dados are slots cut across the grain. They are cut using a dado blade in
the table saw, on a router, or hand chiseled. The uses of a dado are for putting shelves in the sideboards
of a bookcase or other piece of furniture. The dado can be stopped short of the edge of the board to
form a stopped dado. This is useful when you don’t want the joint to be seen.
A joint similar to the dado is a groove. A groove runs with the grain instead of against it. There are
several ways to cut a groove. You can use a dado blade, router, molder, or shaper. A groove is usually
used in making raised panels. It is what holds the pane in between the rails and stiles.
A joint similar to a groove is the spline. The spline joint can either be a solid spline like tongue and
groove. That is where one board has a groove and another one has a piece with both edges are cut off
leaving the middle. A loose spline is a board with two grooves cut and then apiece of wood inserted in
the tow grooves and glued. The uses good for the spline is siding and paneling. It also works fairly well
in making large panels because the tongue helps to keep the boards aligned. You can dress up the spline
joint by putting a chamfer or bead on the edge of the boards.
A good joint for joining backs to furniture is the rebate joint. It also works well for joining the tops and
bottoms of furniture. A rebate joint is a dado at the end or edge of a board and usually has a piece of
wood in it the same thickness as the dado. The wood is usually nailed or screwed into place. Another
version of the rebate joint is one that is stopped. The stopped rebates are used when you don’t want the
joint to show.
A joint that can be quite complicated is the scarf joint. The scarf joint is used to make two boards into a
a longer one. This joint is mostly used in timber frames. The joint came around in Europe when they had
cut all the long big trees down and had to find a way to make the long beams needed for their buildings
(Ramuz, 279). Then when the settlers came to America, they didn’t need it for another hundred years or
so until they did the same thing over here. The joint is usually about eight times longer than the width of
the board or beam. It is made to have a lot of glue surface to make it a fairly strong joint. But it is not as
strong as a full-length board or beam.
Another joint that can be quite complicated until you have the jig made for it is the finger joint. The
finger joint is easy once the jig is made you just have to stand at the table saw and keep running the
boards over the dado bade. The finger joint is several grooves on the end of a board with the other
board cut to mate. They are very strong because it really increases the glue surface. The joint can also be
used as a hinge if the corners are rounded and a dowel put all the way through the joint.
The last two joints left are some of the most complicated ones to design and cut. These joints are the
real give away of quality joinery. If these joints are done properly they can last for hundreds of years and
will really make your work look professional. The two joints are the mortise and tenon and dovetails. You
can either cut these by hand or machine. If cut by machine, they aren’t as complicated to make as they
are when you cut them by hand. The joints aren’t cut by hand as much anymore, but when they are you
can take more pride in your work.
I will start with the mortise and tenon. The mortise and tenon has been around for hundreds and hundreds of years. There are many uses including timber frame, attaching aprons to the legs on tables, and
attaching rails and stiles on doorframes. Mortise and tenon are very strong joints. The timber frame barns
and buildings are still standing after hundreds of years. The only reason they fall is because of decay and
neglect. The mortise is a square hold cut to a certain depth and size. A through mortise is a square hole
that is cut all the way through the board or beam. The tenon is the mate to a mortise. It is a square cut
on the end of a board or beam. They are usually in the center of the board but can be offset if there is
going to be more than one joint in the same spot. It also could be offset if it was going to be close to the
edge of the other post or leg. A through tenon can look good with a wedge, or you can peg the tenon for
strength. Mortises can be cut with a mortise, router, or drilled out and squared up with a chisel. Tenons
can be cut by router, table saw, or by hand. But whatever way you do it they still mean good quality
work.
The other hallmark of quality wood joinery is the dovetail. Dovetails can either be cut by a router and
template or by hand with a lot of practice. A dovetail is similar to a finger joint except that it has angles.
The dovetail has been around for thousands of years and there is a reason why. It is very aesthetically
pleasing and strong enough to last for a very long time. Dovetails are very strong because it is made to
pull apart in only one direction so from any other direction it can handle extreme loads.
Now to make dovetails by hand you need to take your time and be patient. They aren’t as hard as you
may think but does take practice. When the joint is completely cut it should fit together with a light push
and should be very stiff. Dovetails are used in making drawer frames and the main box in cabinets. There
are two types of dovetails and they are through dovetails and half-blind dovetails. Through dovetails
are the ones where both boards go all the way through each other leaving the joint exposed. Half-blind
dovetails are usually used to attach drawer fronts to the rest of the frame. On those, only half of the joint
is visible because the other half ends short by 1/8 inch or more.
Now that you know the basics, here are a few more things you should know to make strong dovetails. If
creating dovetails out of softwood, you should have a slope of 1 to 6 on the dovetails. If making them out
of hardwood, the angle should be 1 to 8 (AM-wood.com). The reason for this is because softwood splits
easier, this way the dovetail won’t spread the wood as much when pulled on. If you are making multiple
joints it is better to make a pattern so they are all the same. Plus it won’t take as long because you won’t
have to lay them out every time. Dovetails are made up of two parts and they are pins and tails. It doesn’t
matter which ones you choose to cut first but you should always trace its mate to get a perfect fit.
That is all twelve woodworking joints. Now lets talk about beefing them up a little. Sure there are nails,
screws, and other mechanical fasteners, but I’m talking about shop made ones. Dowels and biscuits are
excellent ways to strengthen joints unnoticeably. But wedges, pegs, and wooden blocks are good ways
and could even add some decoration. On through tenons, you can cut slots in the end of the tenon and
add some wedges as a design and a way to keep it from pulling out. On mortise and tenons you can drill
a hole and insert a peg for strength and looks.
To sum it all up there is a lot of information on the twelve different wood joints. Some of them can be
quite complicated but with practice you could become an amateur woodworker. I have learned a lot
about the different joints and techniques behind them. This research helped a lot in deciding what joints
to use and how to construct them for my tech project. My tech project is designing and building a gun
cabinet. In my gun cabinet I’m going to use rebates, grooves, dados, lock miters, dovetails, mortise
and tenon and lap joints. I hope you have learned as much as I have about choosing and creating
joints in wood. There is still more to be learned but this is a very good start in becoming a professional
woodworker.

there be no end grain but it isn t very strong but biscuit can be add for some extra strength the next joint be the dado joint dado be slots cut across the grain they be cut use a dado blade in the table saw on a router or hand chisel the us of a dado be for put shelf in the sideboard of a bookcase or other piece of furniture the dado can be stop short of the edge of the board to form a stopped dado this be useful when you don t want the joint to be see a joint similar to the dado be a groove a groove run with the grain instead of against it there be several way to cut a groove you can use a dado blade router molder or shaper a groove be usually use in make raise panel it be what hold the pane in between the rail and stiles a joint similar to a groove be the spline the spline joint can either be a solid spline like tongue and groove that be where one board have a groove and another one have a piece with both edge be cut off leave the middle a loose spline be a board with two groove cut and then apiece of wood insert in the tow groove and glue the us good for the spline be side and panel it also work fairly well in make large panel because the tongue help to keep the board align you can dress up the spline joint by put a chamfer or bead on the edge of the board a good joint for join back to furniture be the rebate joint it also work well for join the top and bottom of furniture a rebate joint be a dado at the end or edge of a board and usually have a piece of wood in it the same thickness a the dado the wood be usually nail or screw into place another version of the rebate joint be one that be stop the stopped rebate be use when you don t want the joint to show a joint that can be quite complicate be the scarf joint the scarf joint be use to make two board into a a longer one this joint be mostly use in timber frame the joint come around in europe when they have cut all the long big tree down and have to find a way to make the long beam need for their building ramuz then when the settler come to america they didn t need it for another hundred year or so until they do the same thing over here the joint be usually about eight time longer than the width of the board or beam it be make to have a lot of glue surface to make it a fairly strong joint but it be not as strong a a full length board or beam another joint that can be quite complicate until you have the jig make for it be the finger joint the finger joint be easy once the jig be make you just have to stand at the table saw and keep run the board over the dado bid the finger joint be several groove on the end of a board with the other board cut to mate they be very strong because it really increase the glue surface the joint can also be use a a hinge if the corner be round and a dowel put all the way through the joint the last two joint leave be some of the most complicated one to design and cut these joint be the real give away of quality joinery if these joint be do properly they can last for hundred of year and will really make your work look professional the two joint be the mortise and tenon and dovetail you can either cut these by hand or machine if cut by machine they aren t as complicate to make a they be when you cut them by hand the joint aren t cut by hand as much anymore but when they be you can take more pride in your work i will start with the mortise and tenon the mortise and tenon have be around for hundred and hundred of year there be many us include timber frame attach apron to the leg on table and attach rail and stile on doorframe mortise and tenon be very strong joint the timber frame barn and building be still stand after hundred of year the only reason they fall be because of decay and neglect the mortise be a square hold cut to a certain depth and size a through mortise be a square hole that be cut all the way through the board or beam the tenon be the mate to a mortise it be a square cut on the end of a board or beam they be usually in the center of the board but can be offset if there be go to be more than one joint in the same spot it also could be offset if it be go to be close to the edge of the other post or leg a through tenon can look good with a wedge or you can peg the tenon for strength mortise can be cut with a mortise router or drill out and square up with a chisel tenon can be cut by router table saw or by hand but whatever way you do it they still mean good quality work the other hallmark of quality wood joinery be the dovetail dovetail can either be cut by a router and template or by hand with a lot of practice a dovetail be similar to a finger joint except that it have angle the dovetail have be around for thousand of year and there be a reason why it be very aesthetically please and strong enough to last for a very long time dovetail be very strong because it be make to pull apart in only one direction so from any other direction it can handle extreme load now to make dovetail by hand you need to take your time and be patient they aren t as hard a you may think but do take practice when the joint be completely cut it should fit together with a light push and should be very stiff dovetail be use in make drawer frame and the main box in cabinet there be two type of dovetail and they be through dovetail and half blind dovetail through dovetail be the one where both board go all the way through each other leave the joint expose half blind dovetail be usually use to attach drawer front to the rest of the frame on those only half of the joint be visible because the other half end short by inch or more now that you know the basic here be a few more thing you should know to make strong dovetail if create dovetail out of softwood you should have a slope of to on the dovetail if make them out of hardwood the angle should be to be wood com the reason for this be because softwood split easier this way the dovetail win t spread the wood as much when pull on if you be make multiple joint it be well to make a pattern so they be all the same plus it win t take a long because you win t have to lay them out every time dovetail be make up of two part and they be pin and tail it doesn t matter which one you choose to cut first but you should always trace it mate to get a perfect fit that be all twelve woodworking joint now let talk about beef them up a little sure there be nails screw and other mechanical fastener but i m talk about shop make one dowel and biscuit be excellent way to strengthen joint unnoticeably but wedge peg and wooden block be good way and could even add some decoration on through tenon you can cut slot in the end of the tenon and add some wedge a a design and a way to keep it from pull out on mortise and tenon you can drill a hole and insert a peg for strength and look to sum it all up there be a lot of information on the twelve different wood joint some of them can be quite complicate but with practice you could become an amateur woodworker i have learn a lot about the different joint and technique behind them this research help a lot in decide what joint to use and how to construct them for my tech project my tech project be design and build a gun cabinet in my gun cabinet i m go to use rebate groove dado lock miter dovetail mortise and tenon and lap joint i hope you have learn as much a i have about choosing and create joint in wood there be still more to be learn but this be a very good start in become a professional woodworker,"+ have you ever wondered how to design complex wood joinery ? + the types of wood joinery have been
around for thousands of years . + there are only twelve different main types of joints but there are many
that combine more than one for aesthetics or strength . + the first step in designing joints is understanding
the different types and what their uses are . + after you understand the strengths and weaknesses of the
different joints you can compare and contrast the joints for aesthetics . + this and a lot of practice are what
make excellent wood joinery . 
+ the first step in designing joints is to figure out what way the wood will move so it won’t destroy the
joint . + then figure in the stresses that will be put on the joint . + the three types of stresses on joints are
compression , tension , and shear . + compression is the weight pushing down on another piece and making
it crush down . + tension is things being pulled apart . + shear is when a piece breaks off when overloaded . 
+ there are two categories of joints there are sawed joints and shaped joints . A sawed joint is one that can
be cut in one pass with a saw . + the shaped joints can be complicated and take multiple cuts . + joints are
either made to lock together which are the shaped ones or to make glue surfaces to glue together which
are the sawed ones . + the twelve types of joints are the butt joints , miter joints , rebate joints , dado joints , 
groove joints , and lap joints are sawed joints . + scarf joints , finger joints , dovetails , mortise and tenon , 
dowel joints , and spline joints are shaped joints . 
+ to lay out good joints there are a few tools necessary . + you need a good square that is accurate , a steel
ruler for measuring , a miter square , a sliding bevel , a protractor , and a caliper . + the square is to draw
perfect ninety - degree lines . + the miter square is so you can check your miters for accuracy . + the sliding
bevel and protractor is to draw angles other than forty - five degrees . + the caliper is to make sure the
pieces getting joined are the right thickness . 
+ for a good joint the fit should be tight . + but if it is too tight it is not good because the wood joint could
crack or break . + it should be tight enough that you can either push it together or give it a light tap with a
hammer to seat it . + another reason it can’t be too tight is because when the glue is applied the wood will
expand . + then it may not fit . + the reason the wood expands is because putting the glue on is like putting
water on it . 
+ the way to make a tight joint is in the layout . A marking knife is a lot more accurate than a pencil . + also
make sure you use the same ruler throughout the project because there could be slight variations in
different ones . + always mark the waste side of the line and make sure you follow on the right side of the
line . + if you cut on the wrong side of the line it will not be tight enough . 
+ now that you know what tools to use the next thing in tight joinery is to make sure all the pieces are the
same thickness or the thickness needed . + boards should be cut to a rough length so they are easier to
run through the machines . + this will leave less room for error because the pieces won’t be so bulky . + also
make sure that the plywood is the thickness it’s claimed to be because it could be off 1 / 64 of an inch . 
+ whenever possible trace the mate for the joint to ensure a good fit . 
+ if the joint is cut too small there are four different repairs . + you can fill small gaps with a mixture of
sawdust of the same species of wood and glue . + for loose parts you can add shims and sand or file to fit . 
+ you could also make a design feature for loose parts . A slot cut in the end of a loose tenon with a wedge
put in it makes a nice design feature . + but if it is real noticeable you should just replace it . + when buying
lumber , always make sure you buy a couple of extra boards for mistakes or defects you didn’t notice
when you bought it . 
+ out of the twelve different joints , I’ll start with the ones easiest to make . + butt joints are the easiest joints
to make . A butt joint is wood joined face to edge or edge to end . + there are several ways to attach the
two pieces . + they can be nailed or screwed together but should have a pilot hole drilled or the pieces
may split . + corrugated or metal fasteners can be used . + also you can make wooden triangles or blocks to strengthen up corners . + the pieces can also be doweled together , which is one of the stronger ways to
attach the two pieces . + the two pieces can also be biscuit jointed together which is another fairly strong
way to attach them . 
+ another fairly simple joint is the lap joint . + the lap joint is where the two pieces of wood to be joined are
cut so only half the thickness of each piece is left . + they are then glued , nailed , or screwed together . + the
lap joint is mostly used for frames that will have plywood on them . + the joint is also used in latticework , 
which is used for decoration in different pieces of furniture . + the downside to this joint is that it isn’t very
strong but it does look nice in some applications . 
+ the next joint is a little more complicated but still fairly simple . + the only thing complicated about the
miter joint is figuring out the angles for different shapes . A square is simple but you have to make sure
the saw is exactly square or the joints won’t fit tight . + but as you get into different sided shapes the
angles are harder to figure out , especially if they have to be a compound miter . + that is where it is cut on
an angle in two different directions . + the miter joint looks good because there is no end grain but it isn’t
very strong . + but biscuits can be added for some extra strength . 
+ the next joint is the dado joint . + dados are slots cut across the grain . + they are cut using a dado blade in
the table saw , on a router , or hand chiseled . + the uses of a dado are for putting shelves in the sideboards
of a bookcase or other piece of furniture . + the dado can be stopped short of the edge of the board to
form a stopped dado . + this is useful when you don’t want the joint to be seen . 
A joint similar to the dado is a groove . A groove runs with the grain instead of against it . + there are
several ways to cut a groove . + you can use a dado blade , router , molder , or shaper . A groove is usually
used in making raised panels . + it is what holds the pane in between the rails and stiles . 
A joint similar to a groove is the spline . + the spline joint can either be a solid spline like tongue and
groove . + that is where one board has a groove and another one has a piece with both edges are cut off
leaving the middle . A loose spline is a board with two grooves cut and then apiece of wood inserted in
the tow grooves and glued . + the uses good for the spline is siding and paneling . + it also works fairly well
in making large panels because the tongue helps to keep the boards aligned . + you can dress up the spline
joint by putting a chamfer or bead on the edge of the boards . 
A good joint for joining backs to furniture is the rebate joint . + it also works well for joining the tops and
bottoms of furniture . A rebate joint is a dado at the end or edge of a board and usually has a piece of
wood in it the same thickness as the dado . + the wood is usually nailed or screwed into place . + another
version of the rebate joint is one that is stopped . + the stopped rebates are used when you don’t want the
joint to show . 
A joint that can be quite complicated is the scarf joint . + the scarf joint is used to make two boards into a
a longer one . + this joint is mostly used in timber frames . + the joint came around in + europe when they had
cut all the long big trees down and had to find a way to make the long beams needed for their buildings
 ( + ramuz , 279 ) . + then when the settlers came to + america , they didn’t need it for another hundred years or
so until they did the same thing over here . + the joint is usually about eight times longer than the width of
the board or beam . + it is made to have a lot of glue surface to make it a fairly strong joint . + but it is not as
strong as a full - length board or beam . 
+ another joint that can be quite complicated until you have the jig made for it is the finger joint . + the
finger joint is easy once the jig is made you just have to stand at the table saw and keep running the
boards over the dado bade . + the finger joint is several grooves on the end of a board with the other
board cut to mate . + they are very strong because it really increases the glue surface . + the joint can also be
used as a hinge if the corners are rounded and a dowel put all the way through the joint . 
+ the last two joints left are some of the most complicated ones to design and cut . + these joints are the
real give away of quality joinery . + if these joints are done properly they can last for hundreds of years and
will really make your work look professional . + the two joints are the mortise and tenon and dovetails . + you
can either cut these by hand or machine . + if cut by machine , they aren’t as complicated to make as they
are when you cut them by hand . + the joints aren’t cut by hand as much anymore , but when they are you
can take more pride in your work . 
I will start with the mortise and tenon . + the mortise and tenon has been around for hundreds and hundreds of years . + there are many uses including timber frame , attaching aprons to the legs on tables , and
attaching rails and stiles on doorframes . + mortise and tenon are very strong joints . + the timber frame barns
and buildings are still standing after hundreds of years . + the only reason they fall is because of decay and
neglect . + the mortise is a square hold cut to a certain depth and size . A through mortise is a square hole
that is cut all the way through the board or beam . + the tenon is the mate to a mortise . + it is a square cut
on the end of a board or beam . + they are usually in the center of the board but can be offset if there is
going to be more than one joint in the same spot . + it also could be offset if it was going to be close to the
edge of the other post or leg . A through tenon can look good with a wedge , or you can peg the tenon for
strength . + mortises can be cut with a mortise , router , or drilled out and squared up with a chisel . + tenons
can be cut by router , table saw , or by hand . + but whatever way you do it they still mean good quality
work . 
+ the other hallmark of quality wood joinery is the dovetail . + dovetails can either be cut by a router and
template or by hand with a lot of practice . A dovetail is similar to a finger joint except that it has angles . 
+ the dovetail has been around for thousands of years and there is a reason why . + it is very aesthetically
pleasing and strong enough to last for a very long time . + dovetails are very strong because it is made to
pull apart in only one direction so from any other direction it can handle extreme loads . 
+ now to make dovetails by hand you need to take your time and be patient . + they aren’t as hard as you

are the ones where both boards go all the way through each other leaving the joint exposed . + half - blind
dovetails are usually used to attach drawer fronts to the rest of the frame . + on those , only half of the joint
is visible because the other half ends short by 1 / 8 inch or more . 
+ now that you know the basics , here are a few more things you should know to make strong dovetails . + if
creating dovetails out of softwood , you should have a slope of 1 to 6 on the dovetails . + if making them out
of hardwood , the angle should be 1 to 8 ( + am - *url ) . + the reason for this is because softwood splits
easier , this way the dovetail won’t spread the wood as much when pulled on . + if you are making multiple
joints it is better to make a pattern so they are all the same . + plus it won’t take as long because you won’t
have to lay them out every time . + dovetails are made up of two parts and they are pins and tails . + it doesn’t

10,"Welding is a highly demanded trade across the US. There are many types of welding such as wire feed, stick, TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas), and oxy acetylene welding. I will explain the most perfected and efficient welding process of them all, TIG welding. I will take you through shielding gases, tungsten materials, tungsten shapes and shaping, heat and warp age, welding flaws, and some recommendations to prevent welding flaws. There are many purposes for shielding gases in the welding industry. In general, shielding gases are one of the many variables throughout the TIG welding processes. There are four types of gases and they all have their own characteristics. Shielding gases protect the molten metal and the tungsten from the impurities in the air during welding. Shielding gases also have an effect on the temperature the arc produces and the physical appearance of the weld bead. Flow rates in the TIG welding processes can also affect the shielding aspects of your weld. The four types of shielding gases throughout the TIG welding processes are: argon (Ar), helium (He), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N). Any of those four gases can be mixed together. Argon is a by-product of oxygen and nitrogen. Before it was produced on a huge scale, argon was a rare gas. Since argon is denser than air, argon can shield welds in deep grooves and tight places. But since argon is denser than air, when overhead welding is necessary, flow rates need to be increased because the argon will fall from the weld. Argon is fairly easy to ionize so it makes it convenient for AC (Alternating Current) welding. Helium is a by-product of natural gas. Helium increases your weld penetration. Helium is great for welding aged aluminum and is also great for tube mills since helium allows you to weld at higher speeds. Helium is usually mixed with argon to help the shielding aspects since helium is lighter than air. Helium is not used with the AC since it doesn’t have the cleaning aspects that argon has. Hydrogen is not used so much as a shielding gas as much as an additive to other shielding gases. Hydrogen is used when weld penetration and speed is needed. Hydrogen is not used when welding stainless steel since hydrogen is the number one cause of porosity and cracking in mild and stainless steel. Similar to hydrogen, nitrogen is used as an additive to argon. It also can cause porosity in some ferritic steels. Ferritic steels are defined as a group of stainless steels with a chromium content range of 12-18o. Such steels do not respond well to heat treatment or temperament. Nitrogen is used to increase penetration when welding copper alloys. Nitrogen is also a stabilizer when welding alloys. When it comes to shielding gases it makes a big difference in your welds. There are many characteristics to consider when you weld different materials. Tungsten is a base material the electrode is made of. The electrode is the part of the welding torch that transfers the electrical arc to the weld material. Tungsten materials are another huge variable when it comes to TIG welding. Tungsten materials can affect your weld in similar ways as shielding gases. There are many characteristics of each material and depending upon what you are welding you may have to make some choices. Each tungsten is labeled by a color to make choosing easier. There are five common types of tungstens including: pure tungsten (green), 1 % thorium (yellow) and 2 % thorium (red), 1/4to 1/2 % zirconium (brown), 2 % cerium (orange), 1 % lanthanum (black). Pure tungsten has limited use for AC welding, and has the poorest heat resistance and electron flow, since there is no other material mixed with pure tungsten, it doesn’t have any of there characteristics including electron flow rates or heat resistance. Pure tungsten is mostly used for aluminum and magnesium. Thoriated tungsten improves current flow, but to maintain an arc with thoriated tungsten requires more
voltage. Thorium increases service life of the tungsten and makes arc starting easier. Thoriated tungstens do
not work well with AC welding since it is hard to maintain a ball end shape, which is required for AC welding.
Zirconium tungstens help emit electrons more freely and can be used with AC and DC (Direct Current)
welding processes, unlike thoriated tungstens. Unlike thoriated tungstens zirconium tungstens are not
radioactive. So they have less contamination aspects than thoriated tungstens.
Cerium tungstens have many of the same characteristics as thoriated tungstens, they were actually
made to replace thoriated tungstens since they are not radioactive, which makes them safer. Lithium
tungstens are also non-radioactive like cerium. They are similar to thoriated tungstens, except they have
a higher arc voltage.
Tungsten shaping and heat penetration are directly related to each other. When you change the
thickness of the materials you are welding, you need to maybe consider changing shielding gases or
tungeten types but you also need to think about the shape on the end of the tungsten especially since it
changes weld penetration.
There are three basic shapes to choose from You can modify each as you learn more about all the
variables you can choose from The three basic shapes are: pointed end, rounded end, and tapered with
ball end (FIGURE 1).
There are special ways to grind and shape your tungstens. When you grind your tungsten, you need to
make sure you use a grinding wheel that you have never grinded with before. If you use a used grinding
wheel, the tungsten may become contaminated, and eventually contaminate the metal you are welding.
You also need to make sure when you grind a point on your tungsten, to grind the tungsten parallel to
the grinding wheel. Grinding your tungsten parallel to the grinding wheel allows electrons to flow easier,
and prevents further contamination to the tungsten. You need to make sure when grinding a pointed
end tungsten that the length of the tapered part of the tungsten is twice as long as the diameter of
the tungsten. Tungsten shape and shaping is another large element of TIG welding that needs to be
considered to make your welds most efficient.

Heat is the main reason for warpage in the welding industry. Warpage needs to be considered when
welding since the shape of the material will change after applying heat. There are different ways metals
warp depending on where the heat is applied and how much heat is applied. Many professional welders
know through experience how much a project will warp with different settings on the welder. They
can also predict and correct warpage before it happens. Warpage can also depend on tungsten shape,
tungsten material, amperage, shielding gases, weld angles and weld distances. There are also different
ways metal warps depending on the weld joint.
(figure not reprinted here)
As shown in FIGURE 2, once the heat from the welding process is applied to the objects, the two arrows
show which way the metal is warped. The two dots represent the weld. There are many different ways
metal can warp and this shows just an idea of how the weld warps the metal.
There are many TIG welding flaws you can run into when you are not fully experienced. These flaws must
be looked at, especially when people’s lives depend on it, such as in constructing bridges and buildings.
Many common welding failures are caused by welding flaws such as porosity, inclusions, inadequate
penetration, and cracks, just to name a few. All of these problems can cause your weld to be weaker than
you intended.
Porosity is caused when gases are dissolved in the weld, forming air bubbles in and on the weld. The
result of porosity is caused by improper shielding gases or pressure settings. The shielding gases are
what protect the molten metal when welding and eliminates porosity.
Inclusions are when non-metallic metals such as slag enters the molten metal. This can be caused by
multiple weld starts. It can be fixed by welding one continuous bead. Inadequate penetration can weaken the weld severely along with inclusions and porosity. When you
don’t get the right amount of penetration you don’t allow the full amount of materials to fuse together.
The main cause of improper penetration are a misdirected arc and not enough amperage. Simply, the
weld bead is too small for the job.
Cracks are another flaw that can have drastic effects. Cracks are caused during the solidifying stages of
welding. When the metals drastically drop temperature, the weld materials are vulnerable to cracking.
Slowing your weld speed is one of the main corrections to cracking. When welding it is most important
to ask questions if you need to since someone’s life could depend on it.
TIG welding processes can weld many more materials than wire feed of stick welding. TIG welding
processes are capable of welding many types of materials such as: copper, aluminum, mild and low
carbon steels, stainless steel, and magnesium. This is what makes TIG welding so different than any other
welding process. You can weld so many different materials. This is where TIG welding becomes the most
perfected welding process in the welding industry. The TIG welding process can weld the most materials
of all the welding processes.
Some recommendations will help you perform better welds, these fall into categories like welding
angles, arc distance control, tungsten types, and shielding gas considerations. TIG welding can be a
lot to take in when it comes to an essay, but if you can remember different recommendations such as
these you will increase your abilities to weld with a TIG welder. The first recommendation is to consider
all your variables throughout the whole process, ask questions when needed and take your time. Speed
will eventually come as time goes on. To clear up how the TIG welding process works check out the
illustration below.

Now that you know about some recommendations on how to improve your weld abilities, I will explain
how to protect yourself during welding. Safety is a huge deal when it comes to welding in general. You
need the proper protective equipment to make your job or experience as safe as it can be. You need
to protect your eyes, skin, and lungs. You need a proper welding helmet to protect your eyes and face
from the bright arc and spatter. You will also need thick gloves and a long sleeve cotton shirt to protect
your skin from burning from the bright light. You should leave no skin uncovered or unprotected. Burns
can lead to blindness and skin cancer. You should also have pants and steel toe boots to protect against
further burns or falling objects. A respirator should be used when welding specific metals to protect your
respiratory system from cancer and other damage.
Learning about TIG welding has been a very helpful experience for me since it will help me in my college
career, and in my job after school. I am going to be a certified welder. This learning experience has
helped me greatly. TIG welding is something that needs to be learned not only by textbook or paper
but also by hands on learning. And thankfully, I have gotten that experience to weld hands on. It makes
learning so much easier",welding be a highly demanded trade across the u there be many type of weld such a wire feed stick tig tungsten inert gas and oxy acetylene weld i will explain the most

characteristic of each material and depend upon what you be weld you may have to make some choice each tungsten be label by a color to make choose easy there be five common type of tungsten include pure tungsten green thorium yellow and thorium red to zirconium brown cerium orange lanthanum black pure tungsten have limit use for ac welding and have the poor heat resistance and electron flow since there be no other material mixed with pure tungsten it doesn t have any of there characteristic include electron flow rate or heat resistance pure tungsten be mostly use for aluminum and magnesium thoriate tungsten improves current flow but to maintain an arc with thoriated tungsten require more voltage thorium increase service life of the tungsten and make arc start easy thoriate tungsten do not work well with ac weld since it be hard to maintain a ball end shape which be require for ac weld zirconium tungsten help emit electron more freely and can be use with ac and dc direct current welding process unlike thoriate tungsten unlike thoriate tungsten zirconium tungsten be not radioactive so they have less contamination aspect than thoriate tungsten cerium tungsten have many of the same characteristic a thoriate tungsten they be actually make to replace thoriate tungsten since they be not radioactive which make them safer lithium tungsten be also non radioactive like cerium they be similar to thoriate tungsten except they have a high arc voltage tungsten shape and heat penetration be directly relate to each other when you change the thickness of the material you be weld you need to maybe consider change shield gas or tungeten type but you also need to think about the shape on the end of the tungsten especially since it change weld penetration there be three basic shape to choose from you can modify each a you learn more about all the variable you can choose from the three basic shape be pointed end round end and taper with ball end figure there be special way to grind and shape your tungsten when you grind your tungsten you need to make sure you use a grinding wheel that you have never grind with before if you use a used grinding wheel the tungsten may become contaminated and eventually contaminate the metal you be weld you also need to make sure when you grind a point on your tungsten to grind the tungsten parallel to the grind wheel grind your tungsten parallel to the grind wheel allows electron to flow easy and prevents further contamination to the tungsten you need to make sure when grind a pointed end tungsten that the length of the tapered part of the tungsten be twice as long a the diameter of the tungsten tungsten shape and shaping be another large element of tig welding that need to be consider to make your weld most efficient figure not reprint here heat be the main reason for warpage in the welding industry warpage need to be consider when weld since the shape of the material will change after apply heat there be different way metal warp depend on where the heat be apply and how much heat be apply many professional welder know through experience how much a project will warp with different setting on the welder they can also predict and correct warpage before it happen warpage can also depend on tungsten shape tungsten material amperage shielding gas weld angle and weld distance there be also different way metal warp depend on the weld joint figure not reprint here a show in figure once the heat from the welding process be apply to the object the two arrow show which way the metal be warp the two dot represent the weld there be many different way metal can warp and this show just an idea of how the weld warp the metal there be many tig weld flaw you can run into when you be not fully experience these flaw must be look at especially when people s live depend on it such a in construct bridge and building many common welding failure be cause by weld flaw such a porosity inclusion inadequate penetration and crack just to name a few all of these problem can cause your weld to be weak than you intended porosity be cause when gas be dissolve in the weld form air bubble in and on the weld the result of porosity be cause by improper shielding gas or pressure settings the shielding gas be what protect the molten metal when welding and eliminate porosity inclusion be when non metallic metal such a slag enter the molten metal this can be cause by multiple weld start it can be fix by weld one continuous bead inadequate penetration can weaken the weld severely along with inclusion and porosity when you don t get the right amount of penetration you don t allow the full amount of material to fuse together the main cause of improper penetration be a misdirected arc and not enough amperage simply the weld bead be too small for the job crack be another flaw that can have drastic effect crack be cause during the solidify stage of weld when the metal drastically drop temperature the weld material be vulnerable to crack slow your weld speed be one of the main correction to crack when weld it be most important to ask question if you need to since someone s life could depend on it tig weld process can weld many more material than wire feed of stick weld tig welding process be capable of weld many type of material such a copper aluminum mild and low carbon steel stainless steel and magnesium this be what make tig weld so different than any other welding process you can weld so many different material this be where tig welding become the most perfected welding process in the welding industry the tig weld process can weld the most material of all the welding process some recommendation will help you perform good weld these fall into category like weld angle arc distance control tungsten type and shield gas consideration tig weld can be a lot to take in when it come to an essay but if you can remember different recommendation such a these you will increase your ability to weld with a tig welder the first recommendation be to consider all your variable throughout the whole process ask question when need and take your time speed will eventually come a time go on to clear up how the tig weld process work check out the illustration below illustration from online source not reprint here now that you know about some recommendation on how to improve your weld ability i will explain how to protect yourself during weld safety be a huge deal when it come to weld in general you need the proper protective equipment to make your job or experience as safe a it can be you need to protect your eye skin and lung you need a proper welding helmet to protect your eye and face from the bright arc and spatter you will also need thick glove and a long sleeve cotton shirt to protect your skin from burn from the bright light you should leave no skin uncover or unprotected burn can lead to blindness and skin cancer you should also have pant and steel toe boot to protect against further burn or fall object a respirator should be use when weld specific metal to protect your respiratory system from cancer and other damage learn about tig welding have be a very helpful experience for me since it will help me in my college career and in my job after school i be go to be a certified welder this learning experience have help me greatly

tungstens are also non - radioactive like cerium . + they are similar to thoriated tungstens , except they have
a higher arc voltage . 
+ tungsten shaping and heat penetration are directly related to each other . + when you change the
thickness of the materials you are welding , you need to maybe consider changing shielding gases or
